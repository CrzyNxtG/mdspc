## 7.3 Timers

The transmitting PDCP entity shall maintain the following timers:

a\) *discardTimer*

This timer is configured only for DRBs. The duration of the timer is
configured by upper layers TS 38.331 \[3\]. In the transmitter, a new
timer is started upon reception of an SDU from upper layer as specified
in clause 5.2.1.

b\) *discardTimerForLowImportance*

This timer is configured only for DRBs. The duration of the timer is
configured by upper layers TS 38.331 \[3\]. In the transmitter, a new
timer is started upon reception of an SDU belonging to a low importance
PDU Set from upper layer as specified in clause 5.2.1.

The receiving PDCP entity shall maintain the following timers:

c\) *t-Reordering*

The duration of the timer is configured by upper layers TS 38.331 \[3\],
except for the case of NR sidelink communication or sidelink SRB4. For
NR sidelink communication or sidelink SRB4, the *t-Reordering* timer is
determined by the UE implementation. This timer is used to detect loss
of PDCP Data PDUs as specified in clause 5.2.2. If *t-Reordering* is
running, *t-Reordering* shall not be started additionally, i.e. only one
*t-Reordering* per receiving PDCP entity is running at a given time.

### 6.2.1 General

A PDCP PDU is a bit string that is byte aligned (i.e. multiple of 8
bits) in length. In the figures in clause 6.2, bit strings are
represented by tables in which the most significant bit is the leftmost
bit of the first line of the table, the least significant bit is the
rightmost bit on the last line of the table, and more generally the bit
string is to be read from left to right and then in the reading order of
the lines. The bit order of each parameter field within a PDCP PDU is
represented with the first and most significant bit in the leftmost bit
and the last and least significant bit in the rightmost bit.

PDCP SDUs are bit strings that are byte aligned (i.e. multiple of 8
bits) in length. A compressed or uncompressed SDU is included into a
PDCP Data PDU from the first bit onward.

### 5.14.3 UDC header

UDC header (1 byte) is added in UDC compression function followed by UDC
data block. The UDC header contains the information about whether the
current PDCP SDU is compressed by UDC protocol or not. Only the
compressed packets are stored in the buffer. The UDC header also
contains a reset bit to inform the decompressor that the compression
buffer has been reset. The validation bits (checksum) of the compression
buffer are also contained in UDC header. Checksum mechanism could be
used to resolve miss-match (if any) between the compression and
de-compression buffers. If both SDAP and UDC are configured for a DRB,
the UDC header shall be located after the SDAP header. Figure 5.14.3-1
shows the location of the UDC header in a PDCP data PDU.

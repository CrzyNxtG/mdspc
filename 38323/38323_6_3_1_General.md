### 6.3.1 General

If not otherwise mentioned in the definition of each field then the bits
in the parameters shall be interpreted as follows: the left most bit
string is the first and most significant and the right most bit is the
last and least significant bit.

Unless otherwise mentioned, integers are encoded in standard binary
encoding for unsigned integers. In all cases the bits appear ordered
from MSB to LSB when read in the PDU.

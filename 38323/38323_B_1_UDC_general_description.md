# B.1 UDC general description

A UDC packet consists of a UDC header and a UDC data block. A UDC data
block contains either DEFLATE compressed blocks generated by UDC
protocol or original PDCP SDU for SDU not compressed by UDC protocol;
the type is specified in FU field (details see Annex B.2.2.1) in UDC
header. The FR field (details see Annex B.2.2.2) and the Checksum field
(details see Annex B.2.2.3) in UDC header are used only if FU field is
set to 1.

If reset procedure is triggered, after performing the reset, the FR
field in UDC header of the first compressed PDU shall be set to 1.

NOTE: UE is allowed not to compress the PDCP SDUs if the UL data rate
before compression is higher than what the UE is capable of.

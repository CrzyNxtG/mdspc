### A.2.2.2 CID

Length: 7, or 15 bits. The length of the CID is configured by upper
layers (*ehc-CID-Length* in TS 38.331 \[3\]).

The CID = \"all zeros\" indicates that the corresponding Ethernet header
is \"uncompressed\". The EHC decompressor does not establish the EHC
context identified by the CID = \"all zeros\".

### 6.3.1 Uplink control information on PUCCH

The procedure in this clause applies to PUCCH formats 2/3/4.

The following clauses 6.3.1.2, 6.3.1.3 and 6.3.1.5 apply regardless of
whether the higher layer parameter *uci-MuxWithDiffPrio* is configured
or not. The following clauses 6.3.1.1, 6.3.1.4 and 6.3.1.6 apply by
assuming *uci-MuxWithDiffPrio* is not configured, or
*uci-MuxWithDiffPrio* is configured and the UCIs for transmission on a
PUCCH are of the same priority index, unless stated otherwise.

If the UE is configured with a PUCCH-SCell, *uci-MuxWithDiffPrio* is
replaced by *uci-MuxWithDiffPrioSecondaryPUCCHgroup* for the secondary
PUCCH group in this clause.

### 7.2.5 Rate matching

Coded bits for each code block, denoted as ![](media/image401.wmf), are
delivered to the rate match block, where ![](media/image67.wmf) is the
code block number, and ![](media/image403.wmf) is the number of encoded
bits in code block number ![](media/image67.wmf). The total number of
code blocks is denoted by ![](media/image400.wmf) and each code block is
individually rate matched according to Clause 5.4.2 by setting
![](media/image987.wmf).

After rate matching, the bits are denoted by![](media/image406.wmf),
where![](media/image407.wmf) is the number of rate matched bits for code
block number ![](media/image67.wmf).

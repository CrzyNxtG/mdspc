### 7.2.3 Code block segmentation and code block CRC attachment

The bits input to the code block segmentation are denoted by
![](media/image18.wmf) where ![](media/image396.wmf) is the number of
bits in the transport block (including CRC).

Code block segmentation and code block CRC attachment are performed
according to Clause 5.2.2.

The bits after code block segmentation are denoted
by![](media/image397.wmf), where ![](media/image67.wmf) is the code
block number and ![](media/image398.wmf) is the number of bits for code
block number ![](media/image67.wmf) according to Clause 5.2.2.

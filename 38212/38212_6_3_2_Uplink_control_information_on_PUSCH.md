### 6.3.2 Uplink control information on PUSCH

The following clauses 6.3.2.2, 6.3.2.3, and 6.3.2.5 apply regardless of
whether the higher layer parameter *uci-MuxWithDiffPrio* is configured
or not. The following clauses 6.3.2.1, 6.3.2.4, and 6.3.2.6 apply by
assuming *uci-MuxWithDiffPrio* is not configured, or
*uci-MuxWithDiffPrio* is configured and the UCIs for transmission on a
PUSCH are of the same priority index, unless stated otherwise.

If the UE is configured with a PUCCH-SCell, *uci-MuxWithDiffPrio* is
replaced by *uci-MuxWithDiffPrioSecondaryPUCCHgroup* for the secondary
PUCCH group in this clause*.*

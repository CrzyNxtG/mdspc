### 7.2.2 LDPC base graph selection

For initial transmission of a transport block with coding rate
![](media/image390.wmf) indicated by the MCS index according to
ClauseÂ 5.1.3.1 in \[6, TS 38.214\] and subsequent re-transmission of the
same transport block, each code block of the transport block is encoded
with either LDPC base graph 1 or 2 according to the following:

\- if ![](media/image985.wmf), or if ![](media/image392.wmf) and
![](media/image393.wmf), or if ![](media/image394.wmf), LDPC base graph
2 is used;

\- otherwise, LDPC base graph 1 is used,

where ![](media/image986.wmf) is the payload size in Clause 7.2.1.

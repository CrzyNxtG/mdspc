### 6.2.6 Code block concatenation

The input bit sequence for the code block concatenation block are the
sequences ![](media/image406.wmf), for ![](media/image372.wmf) and where
![](media/image374.wmf) is the number of rate matched bits for the
![](media/image67.wmf)-th code block.

Code block concatenation is performed according to Clause 5.5.

The bits after code block concatenation are denoted
by![](media/image408.wmf), where ![](media/image409.wmf) is the total
number of coded bits for transmission.

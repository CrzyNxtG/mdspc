### 7.2.4 Channel coding

Code blocks are delivered to the channel coding block. The bits in a
code block are denoted by ![](media/image399.wmf) , where
![](media/image67.wmf) is the code block number, and
![](media/image398.wmf) is the number of bits in code block number
![](media/image67.wmf). The total number of code blocks is denoted by
![](media/image400.wmf) and each code block is individually LDPC encoded
according to Clause 5.3.2.

After encoding the bits are denoted by ![](media/image401.wmf), where
the values of ![](media/image402.wmf) is given in Clause 5.3.2.

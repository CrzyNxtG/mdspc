### 5.4.3 Rate matching for channel coding of small block lengths

The input bit sequence to rate matching is ![](media/image97.wmf). The
output bit sequence after rate matching is denoted as
![](media/image252.wmf), where ![](media/image284.wmf) is the rate
matching output sequence length. The bit sequence
![](media/image252.wmf) is obtained by the following:

for ![](media/image288.wmf) to ![](media/image289.wmf)

![](media/image370.wmf);

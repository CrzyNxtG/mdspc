### 8.3.1 1^st^-stage SCI formats

The fields defined in each of the 1^st^-stage SCI formats below are
mapped to the information bits $a_{0}$ to $a_{A - 1}\ $as follows:

Each field is mapped in the order in which it appears in the
description, with the first field mapped to the lowest order information
bit $a_{0}\ $and each successive field mapped to higher order
information bits. The most significant bit of each field is mapped to
the lowest order information bit for that field, e.g. the most
significant bit of the first field is mapped to $a_{0}$.

### 7.1.4 Channel coding

Information bits are delivered to the channel coding block. They are
denoted by ![](media/image714.wmf) , where ![](media/image96.wmf) is the
number of bits, and they are encoded via Polar coding according to
Clause 5.3.1, by setting ![](media/image981.wmf),
![](media/image982.wmf), ![](media/image727.wmf), and
![](media/image723.wmf).

After encoding the bits are denoted by ![](media/image730.wmf), where
![](media/image731.wmf) is the number of coded bits.

### 5.34.1 General

Each Serving Cell may be configured by RRC with a periodic cell DTX
pattern (i.e., Active and Non-Active Periods). The cell DTX operation
controls UE\'s monitoring activity of PDCCH and configured downlink
assignments in RRC_CONNECTED. For all activated Serving Cells with cell
DTX configured and activated, the MAC entity may monitor PDCCH and
configured downlink assignments using the cell DTX operation specified
in clause 5.34.2.

Each Serving Cell may be configured by RRC with a periodic cell DRX
pattern (i.e., Active and Non-Active Periods). The cell DRX operation
controls Scheduling Request and configured uplink grant transmission
activity in RRC_CONNECTED. For all activated Serving Cells with cell DRX
configured and activated, the MAC entity may transmit configured uplink
grant transmissions and Scheduling Request using the cell DRX operation
specified in clause 5.34.3.

RRC controls cell DTX and cell DRX operation by configuring the
following parameters in *cellDTX-DRX-Config* per Serving Cell:

\- *cellDTX-DRX-ConfigType*: defines whether only cell DTX is
configured, only cell DRX is configured, or both are configured;

\- *cellDTX-DRX-onDurationTimer*: the active duration at the beginning
of a cell DTX/DRX cycle;

\- *cellDTX-DRX-StartOffset*: defines the subframe where the cell
DTX/DRX cycle starts;

\- *cellDTX-DRX-SlotOffset*: the delay before starting the
*cellDTX-DRX-onDurationTimer*;

\- *cellDTX-DRX-Cycle*: the cell DTX/DRX cycle period.

\- *cellDTX-DRX-ActivationStatus*: the initial activation status of cell
DTX and cell DRX operation.

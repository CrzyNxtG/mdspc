### 6.1.1 General

A MAC PDU is a bit string that is byte aligned (i.e. multiple of 8 bits)
in length. In the figures in clause 6, bit strings are represented by
tables in which the most significant bit is the leftmost bit of the
first line of the table, the least significant bit is the rightmost bit
on the last line of the table, and more generally the bit string is to
be read from left to right and then in the reading order of the lines.
The bit order of each parameter field within a MAC PDU is represented
with the first and most significant bit in the leftmost bit and the last
and least significant bit in the rightmost bit.

A MAC SDU is a bit string that is byte aligned (i.e. multiple of 8 bits)
in length. A MAC SDU is included into a MAC PDU from the first bit
onward.

A MAC CE is a bit string that is byte aligned (i.e. multiple of 8 bits)
in length.

A MAC subheader is a bit string that is byte aligned (i.e. multiple of 8
bits) in length. Each MAC subheader is placed immediately in front of
the corresponding MAC SDU, MAC CE, or padding.

The MAC entity shall ignore the value of the Reserved bits in downlink
MAC PDUs.

### 5.21.1 General

The lower layer may perform an LBT procedure, see TS 37.213 \[18\],
according to which a transmission is not performed by lower layers if
the channel is identified as being occupied. When lower layer performs
an LBT procedure before a transmission and the transmission is not
performed, an LBT failure indication is sent to the MAC entity from
lower layers. Unless otherwise specified, when LBT procedure is
performed for a transmission, actions as specified in this specification
are performed regardless of if an LBT failure indication is received
from lower layers. When LBT is not performed by the lower layers, LBT
failure indication is not received from lower layers.

### 5.15.2 Sidelink

In addition to clause 16 of TS 38.213 \[6\], this clause specifies
requirements on BWP operation for sidelink.

The MAC entity is configured with at most a single SL BWP per sidelink
carrier where sidelink transmission and reception are performed.

For a BWP, the MAC entity shall:

1\> if the BWP is activated:

2\> transmit SL-BCH on the BWP, if configured;

2\> transmit S-PSS and S-SSS on the BWP, if configured;

2\> transmit PSCCH on the BWP;

2\> transmit SL-PRS on the BWP;

2\> transmit SL-SCH on the BWP;

2\> receive PSFCH on the BWP, if configured;

2\> receive S-PSS and S-SSS on the BWP, if configured;

2\> receive SL-BCH on the BWP, if configured;

2\> receive PSCCH on the BWP;

2\> receive SL-PRS on the BWP;

2\> receive SL-SCH on the BWP;

2\> transmit PSFCH on the BWP, if configured;

2\> (re-)initialize any suspended configured sidelink grant of
configured grant Type 1.

2\> if *sl-lbt-FailureRecoveryConfig* is configured:

3\> set *SL_LBT_COUNTER* to 0 for all RB sets in the SL BWP;

3\> monitors SL LBT failure indications from lower layers as specified
in clause 5.31.2.

1\> if the BWP is deactivated:

2\> not transmit SL-BCH on the BWP, if configured;

2\> not transmit S-PSS and S-SSS on the BWP, if configured;

2\> not transmit PSCCH on the BWP;

2\> not transmit SL-PRS on the BWP;

2\> not transmit SL-SCH on the BWP;

2\> not receive PSFCH on the BWP, if configured;

2\> not receive SL-BCH on the BWP, if configured;

2\> not receive S-PSS and S-SSS on the BWP, if configured;

2\> not receive PSCCH on the BWP;

2\> not receive SL-PRS on the BWP;

2\> not receive SL-SCH on the BWP;

2\> not transmit PSFCH on the BWP, if configured;

2\> suspend any configured sidelink grant of configured grant Type 1;

2\> clear any configured sidelink grant of configured grant Type 2;

2\> cancel, if any, triggered Scheduling Request procedure for sidelink;

2\> cancel, if any, triggered Sidelink Buffer Status Reporting
procedure;

2\> cancel, if any, triggered Sidelink CSI Reporting procedure;

2\> cancel, if any, triggered Sidelink DRX Command MAC CE;

2\> cancel, if any, triggered Sidelink IUC-Request transmission
procedure;

2\> cancel, if any, triggered Sidelink IUC-Information Reporting
procedure;

2\> cancel, if any, triggered Sidelink consistent LBT failure.

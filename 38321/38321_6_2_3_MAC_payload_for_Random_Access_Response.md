### 6.2.3 MAC payload for Random Access Response

The MAC RAR is of fixed size as depicted in Figure 6.2.3-1, and consists
of the following fields:

\- R: Reserved bit, set to 0;

\- TI: If two TAGs are configured for the Serving Cell in which the
Random Access procedure is being performed, this field indicates one of
the two TAGs to which the Timing Advance Command is applied. If
*tag2-flag* is set to *true* by upper layers, the field set to 0
indicates the *tag2-Id* and the field set to 1 indicates the *tag-Id* of
the Serving Cell, otherwise the field set to 0 indicates the *tag-Id*
and the field set to 1 indicates the *tag2-Id* of the Serving Cell. If
the Serving Cell in which the Random Access procedure is being performed
is not configured with two TAGs, the R bit is present instead;

\- Timing Advance Command: The Timing Advance Command field indicates
the index value *T~A~* used to control the amount of timing adjustment
that the MAC entity has to apply in TS 38.213 \[6\]. The size of the
Timing Advance Command field is 12 bits;

\- UL Grant: The Uplink Grant field indicates the resources to be used
on the uplink in TS 38.213 \[6\]. The size of the UL Grant field is 27
bits;

\- Temporary C-RNTI: The Temporary C-RNTI field indicates the temporary
identity that is used by the MAC entity during Random Access. The size
of the Temporary C-RNTI field is 16 bits.

The MAC RAR is octet aligned.

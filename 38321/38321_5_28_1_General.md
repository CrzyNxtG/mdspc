### 5.28.1 General

The MAC entity may be configured by RRC with an SL DRX functionality
that controls the UE\'s SCI (i.e., 1^st^ stage SCI and 2^nd^ stage SCI)
monitoring activity for unicast, groupcast and broadcast. When using SL
DRX operation, the MAC entity shall also monitor SCI (i.e., 1^st^ stage
SCI and 2^nd^ stage SCI) according to requirements found in other
clauses of this specification.

Sidelink DRX and UE procedure on Dedicated SL-PRS resource pool are not
applied at the same time.

RRC controls Sidelink DRX operation by configuring the following
parameters:

\- *sl-drx-onDurationTimer*/*sl-DRX-GC-BC-OnDurationTimer*: the duration
at the beginning of an SL DRX cycle;

\- *sl-drx-SlotOffset*: the delay before starting the
*sl-drx-onDurationTimer*/*sl-DRX-GC-BC-OnDurationTimer*;

\- *sl-drx-InactivityTimer*/*sl-DRX-GC-InactivityTimer* (except for the
SL broadcast communication): the duration after the first slot of SCI
(i.e., 1^st^ stage SCI and 2^nd^ stage SCI) reception in which an SCI
indicates a new SL transmission for the MAC entity;

\- *sl-drx-RetransmissionTimer*/*sl-DRX-GC-RetransmissionTimer* (per
Sidelink process except for the SL broadcast process): the maximum
duration until an SL retransmission is received;

\- *sl-drx-StartOffset*: defines the subframe where the SL DRX cycle
starts;

\- *sl-drx-Cycle*/*sl-DRX-GC-BC-Cycle*: the Sidelink DRX cycle;

\- *sl-drx-HARQ-RTT-Timer* (per Sidelink process except for the SL
broadcast process): the minimum duration before an SL HARQ
retransmission is expected by the MAC entity.

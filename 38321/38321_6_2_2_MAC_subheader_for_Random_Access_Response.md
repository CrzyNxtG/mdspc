### 6.2.2 MAC subheader for Random Access Response

The MAC subheader consists of the following fields:

\- E: The Extension field is a flag indicating if the MAC subPDU
including this MAC subheader is the last MAC subPDU or not in the MAC
PDU. The E field is set to 1 to indicate at least another MAC subPDU
follows. The E field is set to 0 to indicate that the MAC subPDU
including this MAC subheader is the last MAC subPDU in the MAC PDU;

\- T: The Type field is a flag indicating whether the MAC subheader
contains a Random Access Preamble ID or a Backoff Indicator. The T field
is set to 0 to indicate the presence of a Backoff Indicator field in the
subheader (BI). The T field is set to 1 to indicate the presence of a
Random Access Preamble ID field in the subheader (RAPID);

\- R: Reserved bit, set to 0;

\- BI: The Backoff Indicator field identifies the overload condition in
the cell. The size of the BI field is 4 bits;

\- RAPID: The Random Access Preamble IDentifier field identifies the
transmitted Random Access Preamble (see clause 5.1.3). The size of the
RAPID field is 6 bits. If the RAPID in the MAC subheader of a MAC subPDU
corresponds to one of the Random Access Preambles configured for SI
request, MAC RAR is not included in the MAC subPDU.

The MAC subheader is octet aligned.

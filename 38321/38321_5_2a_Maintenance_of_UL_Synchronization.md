## 5.2a Maintenance of UL Synchronization

The MAC entity shall for each Serving Cell:

1\> if an indication of uplink synchronization has been received from
upper layers (see clauses 5.2.2.6 and 5.7.19 of TS 38.331 \[5\]):

2\> if indication of uplink synchronization is received after indication
of uplink synchronization loss due to satellite switch with
re-synchronization (see clause 5.7.19 of TS 38.331 \[5\]):

3\> set N~TA~ value (as defined in TS 38.211 \[8\]) to zero for PTAG;

3\> indicate to lower layers a Differential Koffset with value zero.

2\> allow uplink transmission on the Serving Cell.

1\> if an indication of uplink synchronization loss is received from
upper layers (see clause 5.2.2.6 and 5.7.19 of TS 38.331 \[5\]):

2\> if uplink synchronization loss is due to satellite switch with
re-synchronization (see clause 5.7.19 of TSÂ 38.331 \[5\]):

3\> not perform any uplink transmission on the Serving Cell.

2\> else:

3\> flush all HARQ buffers;

3\> not perform any uplink transmission on the Serving Cell.

NOTE: The MAC entity suspends all UL operations (e.g. stop RACH, SR, and
UL HARQ operation) after receiving the indication of an uplink
synchronization loss and resumes the operation when receiving an
indication of uplink synchronization.

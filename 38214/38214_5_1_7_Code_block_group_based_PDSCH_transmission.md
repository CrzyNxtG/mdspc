### 5.1.7 Code block group based PDSCH transmission

If a UE is configured to receive code block group (CBG) based
transmissions by receiving the higher layer parameter
*PDSCH-CodeBlockGroupTransmission* in *PDSCH-ServingCellConfig* on a
serving cell in a PUCCH group, the UE does not expect to be configured
with higher layer parameter *ScheduledCell-ListDCI-1-3* on any serving
cell within the PUCCH group.

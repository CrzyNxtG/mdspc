### 16.1.4 CQI and MCS

For channel state reporting, a CQI table for target block error rate
10^-5^ is introduced.

For scheduling data packets with higher reliability, 64QAM MCS tables
containing entries with lower spectral efficiency are introduced for
both downlink and uplink. The tables are different for CP-OFDM and
DFT-s-OFDM. The MCS tables can be configured semi-statically or
dynamically. The dynamic signalling of MCS table is supported by
configuring UE with MCS-C-RNTI, where the scrambling of DCI CRC by
MCS-C-RNTI indicates the 64QAM MCS tables with entries of lower spectral
efficiency.

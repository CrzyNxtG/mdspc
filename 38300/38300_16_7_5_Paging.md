### 16.7.5 Paging

The NG-RAN node may receive a paging message including the list of CAGs
allowed for the UE, and whether the UE is allowed to access non-CAG
cells. The NG-RAN node may use this information to avoid paging in cells
on which the UE is not allowed to camp.

For UEs in RRC_INACTIVE state, the NG-RAN node may page a neighbour
NG-RAN node including the list of CAGs allowed for the UE, and whether
the UE is allowed to access non-CAG cells. The neighbour NG-RAN node may
use this information to avoid paging in cells on which the UE is not
allowed to camp.

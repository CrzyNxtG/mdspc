### 16.6.1 General

An SNPN is a network deployed for non-public use which does not rely on
network functions provided by a PLMN (see clause 4.8). An SNPN is
identified by a PLMN ID and NID (see clause 8.2) broadcast in SIB1.

An SNPN-capable UE supports the SNPN access mode. When the UE is set to
operate in SNPN access mode, the UE only selects and registers with
SNPNs. When the UE is not set to operate in SNPN access mode, the UE
performs normal PLMN selection procedures.

Emergency services and ETWS /CMAS can be supported by SNPNs. An IMS
Emergency call support indication is provided per SNPN to inform the UE
which SNPN(s) support emergency bearer. In normal service state the
indication is provided in the same way as in case of PLMNs (see clause
16.5.2). In limited service state and for emergency services other than
eCall over IMS, a UE is informed whether an SNPN of the cell supports
emergency services over NG-RAN from a per SNPN broadcast indication
(*imsEmergencySupportForSNPN*). The broadcast indicator for an SNPN may
be set to \"support\" if any AMF of the SNPN supports IMS emergency
bearer services.

NR-NR Dual Connectivity within a single SNPN or across SNPNs as
indicated in the mobility restriction list is supported.

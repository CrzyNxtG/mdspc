### 16.10.2 Network Architecture

The overall NG-RAN architecture specified in clause 4 applies for NR
MBS. MBS multicast can only be supported in MCG side in NE-DC and NR-DC
scenarios, i.e., only for MN-terminated MCG MRB. The configuration of
MBS broadcast on SCG is not supported for the UE.

The QoS model for NR MBS can be found in TS 23.247 \[45\].

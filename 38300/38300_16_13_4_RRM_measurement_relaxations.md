### 16.13.4 RRM measurement relaxations

RRM measurement relaxation is enabled and disabled by the network. In
RRC_IDLE and RRC_INACTIVE an (e)RedCap UE is allowed to relax neighbour
cell RRM measurements when the stationary criterion is met or when both
stationary criterion and not-at-cell-edge criterion are met. Network may
configure stationary criterion for an (e)RedCap UE in RRC_CONNECTED and
the UE reports its RRM measurement relaxation fulfilment status using UE
Assistance Information when the stationarity criterion is met or no
longer met.

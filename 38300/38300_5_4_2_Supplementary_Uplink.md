### 5.4.2 Supplementary Uplink

In conjunction with a UL/DL carrier pair (FDD band) or a bidirectional
carrier (TDD band), a UE may be configured with additional,
Supplementary Uplink (SUL). SUL differs from the aggregated uplink in
that the UE may be scheduled to transmit either on the supplementary
uplink or on the uplink of the carrier being supplemented, but not on
both at the same time.

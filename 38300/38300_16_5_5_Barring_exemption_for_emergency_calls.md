### 16.5.5 Barring exemption for emergency calls

The network may allow (e)RedCap UEs and 2Rx XR UEs to consider the cell
as an acceptable cell to perform emergency calls in the cell, even if
the cell would otherwise be considered as barred due to the cell barring
indication in SIB1 for (e)RedCap UEs or 2Rx XR UEs. This is enabled via
the *barringExemptEmergencyCall* by the network (see TS 38.304 \[10\]
and TS 38.331 \[12\]).

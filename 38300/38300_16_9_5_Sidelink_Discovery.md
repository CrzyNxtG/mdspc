### 16.9.5 Sidelink Discovery

The UE may perform NR sidelink discovery while in-coverage or
out-of-coverage for non-relay operation.

The Relay discovery mechanism described in clause 16.12.3 (except the
U2N Relay specific threshold based discovery message transmission and
U2N Relay specific resource allocation mode restriction) is also applied
to sidelink discovery.

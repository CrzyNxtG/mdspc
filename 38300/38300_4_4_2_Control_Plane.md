### 4.4.2 Control Plane

The figure below shows the protocol stack for the control plane, where:

\- PDCP, RLC and MAC sublayers (terminated in gNB on the network side)
perform the functions listed in clause 6;

\- RRC (terminated in gNB on the network side) performs the functions
listed in clause 7;

\- NAS control protocol (terminated in AMF on the network side) performs
the functions listed in TS 23.501 \[3\]), for instance: authentication,
mobility management, security control...

# B.3 NR Operation with Shared Spectrum

NR Radio Access operating with shared spectrum channel access can
support the following deployment scenarios:

\- Scenario A: Carrier aggregation between NR in licensed spectrum
(SpCell) and NR in shared spectrum (SCell);

\- Scenario A.1: SCell is not configured with uplink (DL only);

\- Scenario A.2: SCell is configured with uplink (DL+UL).

\- Scenario B: Dual connectivity between LTE in licensed spectrum and NR
in shared spectrum (PSCell);

\- Scenario C: NR in shared spectrum (PCell);

\- Scenario D: NR cell in shared spectrum and uplink in licensed
spectrum;

\- Scenario E: Dual connectivity between NR in licensed spectrum (PCell)
and NR in shared spectrum (PSCell).

Carrier aggregation of cells in shared spectrum is applicable to all
deployment scenarios.

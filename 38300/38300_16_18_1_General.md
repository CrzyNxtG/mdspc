### 16.18.1 General

NR connectivity for UEs capable of Aerial communication is supported via
the following functionalities:

\- subscription-based Aerial UE identification and authorization, as
specified in TS 23.502 \[22\], clause 5.2.3.3.1;

\- altitude reporting based on the measurement event(s) where the UE\'s
altitude has crossed a network-configured reference altitude threshold;

\- altitude-dependent configurations which apply only to specific
altitude regions;

\- interference detection based on a measurement reporting that is
triggered when a configured number of cells (i.e. larger than one)
fulfils the triggering criteria simultaneously;

\- signalling of flight path information from UE to NG-RAN and from the
source gNB to target gNB during handover;

\- location information reporting, including UE\'s horizontal and
vertical velocity;

\- transmitting of BRID and DAA messages via PC5 interface.

### 5.2.6 Downlink Reference Signals and Measurements for Positioning

The DL Positioning Reference Signals (DL PRS) are defined to facilitate
support of different positioning methods such as DL-TDOA, DL-AoD,
multi-RTT through the following set of UE measurements DL RSTD, DL
PRS-RSRP/DL PRS-RSRPP, and UE Rx-Tx time difference respectively as
described in TS 38.305 \[42\]. The DL PRS also facilitates Carrier Phase
Positioning measurements such as DL-RSCP and DL-RSCPD as described in TS
38.305 \[42\].

Besides DL PRS signals, UE can use SSB and CSI-RS for RRM (RSRP and
RSRQ) measurements for E-CID type of positioning.

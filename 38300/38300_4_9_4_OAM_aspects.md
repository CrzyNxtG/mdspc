### 4.9.4 OAM aspects

The transport connection between the NCR-node and its OAM may be
provided by the NCR-MT\'s PDU session. A Network-Controlled Repeater may
be configured with a list of allowed gNB cell(s) that the NCR-MT is
allowed to connect with, and/or a list of forbidden gNB cell(s) that the
NCR-MT is not allowed to connect with.

The information on the physical beam(s) used by NCR-Fwd for access link
may be provided by OAM to the gNB and the Network-Controlled Repeater
for operation. How to characterize and provide the physical beams of
NCR-Fwd is up to implementation.

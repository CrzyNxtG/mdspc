## 4.8 Non-Public Networks

A Non-Public Network (NPN) is a network for non-public use (see TS
22.261 \[19\]), which can be deployed as (see TS 23.501 \[3\]):

\- a Stand-alone Non-Public Network (SNPN) when not relying on network
functions provided by a PLMN; or

\- a Public Network Integrated (PNI) NPN when relying on the support of
a PLMN.

NOTE: As described in clause 5.30.3.1 of TS 23.501 \[3\], there are
several approaches in which PNI-NPNs can be made available via PLMNs.
The only approach visible to AS, and hence the only approach that is
addressed in AS specifications is the approach of using CAGs.

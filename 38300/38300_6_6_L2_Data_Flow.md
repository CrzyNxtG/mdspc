## 6.6 L2 Data Flow

An example of the Layer 2 Data Flow is depicted on Figure 6.6-1, where a
transport block is generated by MAC by concatenating two RLC PDUs from
RB*~x~* and one RLC PDU from RB*~y~*. The two RLC PDUs from RB*~x~* each
corresponds to one IP packet (*n* and *n+1*) while the RLC PDU from
RB*~y~* is a segment of an IP packet (*m*).

NOTE: H depicts the headers and subheaders.

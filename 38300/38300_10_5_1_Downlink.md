### 10.5.1 Downlink

In downlink, for GBR flows, the gNB guarantees the GFBR and ensures that
the MFBR is not exceeded while for non-GBR flows, it ensures that the
UE-AMBR is not exceeded (see clause 12). When configured for a GBR flow,
the gNB also ensures that the MDBV is not exceeded. When received and
supported, the gNB in addition ensures that the UE-Slice-MBR is not
exceeded as specified in TS 23.501 \[3\].

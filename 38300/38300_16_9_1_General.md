### 16.9.1 General

In this clause, an overview of NR sidelink communication and how NG-RAN
supports NR sidelink communication, V2X sidelink communication and
Ranging/Sidelink positioning is given. V2X sidelink communication is
specified in TS 36.300 \[2\]. Ranging/Sidelink positioning is specified
in TS 38.305 \[42\].

The NG-RAN architecture supports the PC5 interface as illustrated in
Figure 16.9.1-1. Sidelink transmission and reception over the PC5
interface are supported when the UE is inside NG-RAN coverage,
irrespective of which RRC state the UE is in, and when the UE is outside
NG-RAN coverage.

Support of V2X services via the PC5 interface can be provided by NR
sidelink communication and/or V2X sidelink communication. NR sidelink
communication may be used to support other services than V2X services.

NR sidelink communication can support one of three types of transmission
modes for a pair of a Source Layer-2 ID and a Destination Layer-2 ID in
the AS:

\- **Unicast transmission**, characterized by:

\- Support of one PC5-RRC connection between peer UEs for the pair;

\- Transmission and reception of control information and user traffic
between peer UEs in sidelink;

\- Support of sidelink HARQ feedback;

> \- Support of sidelink transmit power control;

\- Support of RLC AM;

\- Detection of radio link failure for the PC5-RRC connection.

\- **Groupcast transmission**, characterized by:

\- Transmission and reception of user traffic among UEs belonging to a
group in sidelink;

\- Support of sidelink HARQ feedback.

\- **Broadcast transmission**, characterized by:

\- Transmission and reception of user traffic among UEs in sidelink.

## 10.10 Autonomous Denial for IDC

The network may configure a long-term denial rate per CG by dedicated
RRC signalling to limit the amount of NR UL autonomous denials. Once
configured by the network, the UE can autonomously deny NR UL
transmission. Otherwise, the UE shall not perform any NR UL autonomous
denials for IDC.

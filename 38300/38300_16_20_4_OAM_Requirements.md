### 16.20.4 OAM Requirements

OAM configures the following:

\- The minimum and maximum energy consumption values corresponding to
the minimum and maximum EC index values respectively, based on an
implementation-specific mapping rule, which is unified within a defined
area; and

\- The recommended time interval within which an NG-RAN node selects an
implementation-specific time window for averaging of the measurements of
the NG-RAN node\'s consumed energy.

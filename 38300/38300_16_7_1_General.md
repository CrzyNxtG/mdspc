### 16.7.1 General

A PNI-NPN is a network deployed for non-public use which relies on
network functions provided by a PLMN (see clause 4.8). In PNI-NPN, a
Closed Access Groups (CAG) identifies a group of subscribers who are
permitted to access one or more CAG cells associated to the CAG. A CAG
is identified by a CAG identifier broadcast in SIB1.

A CAG-capable UE can be configured with the following per PLMN (see
clause 5.30.3.3Â of TS 23.501 \[3\]):

\- an Allowed CAG list containing the CAG identifiers which the UE is
allowed to access; and

\- a CAG-only indication if the UE is only allowed to access 5GS via CAG
cells.

Dual Connectivity is supported and may involve both PNI-NPN and PLMN
cells, according to the mobility restrictions in the UE context as
described in TS 37.340 \[21\].

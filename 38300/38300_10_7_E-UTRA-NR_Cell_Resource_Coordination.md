## 10.7 E-UTRA-NR Cell Resource Coordination

An NR cell may use spectrum that overlaps or is adjacent to spectrum in
use for E-UTRA cells. In this case network signalling enables
coordination of TDM and FDM cell resources between MAC in the gNB and
the corresponding entity in the ng-eNB. Both the gNB and the ng-eNB can
trigger the E-UTRA - NR Cell Resource Coordination procedure over Xn to
its peer node.

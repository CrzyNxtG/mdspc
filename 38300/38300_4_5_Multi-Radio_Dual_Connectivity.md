## 4.5 Multi-Radio Dual Connectivity

NG-RAN supports Multi-Radio Dual Connectivity (MR-DC) operation whereby
a UE in RRC_CONNECTED is configured to utilise radio resources provided
by two distinct schedulers, located in two different NG-RAN nodes
connected via a non-ideal backhaul, one providing NR access and the
other one providing either E-UTRA or NR access. Further details of MR-DC
operation, including Conditional PSCell Addition (CPA) and Conditional
PSCell Change (CPC), can be found in TS 37.340 \[21\].

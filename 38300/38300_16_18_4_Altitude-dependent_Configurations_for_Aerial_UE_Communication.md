### 16.18.4 Altitude-dependent Configurations for Aerial UE Communication

An Aerial UE can be configured with multiple altitude-dependent
configurations, each of which is applied in its corresponding altitude
range. Altitude-dependent configurations can be provided independently
in measurement object (i.e. *SSB-ToMeasureAltitudeBased* in TS 38.331
\[12\]) and an Aerial UE uses those when in RRC_CONNECTED.

### 16.13.1 Introduction

A RedCap UE has reduced capabilities with the intention to have lower
complexity with respect to non-RedCap UEs. It is mandatory for a RedCap
UE to support 20 MHz maximum UE channel bandwidth in FR1 and 100 MHz in
FR2. An eRedCap UE has further reduced capabilities with the intention
to have lower complexity with respect to RedCap UEs. It is mandatory for
an eRedCap UE to support reduced DL/UL peak data rate of 10 Mbps, with
or without reduced baseband bandwidth of 5 MHz for unicast PDSCH/PUSCH
in FR1.

## 6.9 Supplementary Uplink

In case of Supplementary Uplink (SUL, see TS 38.101-1 \[18\]), the UE is
configured with 2 ULs for one DL of the same cell, and uplink
transmissions on those two ULs are controlled by the network to avoid
overlapping PUSCH/PUCCH transmissions in time. Overlapping transmissions
on PUSCH are avoided through scheduling while overlapping transmissions
on PUCCH are avoided through configuration (PUCCH can only be configured
for only one of the 2 ULs of the cell). In addition, initial access is
supported in each of the uplink (see clause 9.2.6). An example of SUL is
given in Annex B.

### 16.22.1 Introduction

A 2Rx XR UE is an XR UE that is not (e)RedCap and is equipped with only
two Rx antenna ports in frequency bands where 4Rx antenna ports are
mandated as specified in TS 38.101-1 \[18\], in which it is also defined
as two antenna port XR UE. No other relaxations in UE capabilities are
allowed for 2Rx XR UEs.

2Rx XR UEs are intended only for use in XR devices that are worn on
human head and whose constrained form factors have limited volume
available for Rx chains.

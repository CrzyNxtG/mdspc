38.305 \[42\].

The periodic, semipersistent and aperiodic transmission of SRS for
positioning is defined for gNB UL RTOA, UL SRS-RSRP/UL-SRS-RSRPP,
UL-AoA, gNB Rx-Tx time difference measurements to facilitate support of
UL TDOA, UL AoA and multi-RTT positioning methods as described in TS
38.305 \[42\]. Carrier phase positioning measurement UL-RSCP can be used
by UL TDOA or multi-RTT positioning methods as described in TS 38.305

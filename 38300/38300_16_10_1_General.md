### 16.10.1 General

NR system enables resource efficient delivery of multicast/broadcast
services (MBS).

For broadcast communication service, the same service and the same
specific content data are provided simultaneously to all UEs in a
geographical area (i.e., all UEs in the broadcast service area as
defined in TS 23.247 \[45\] are authorized to receive the data). A
broadcast communication service is delivered to the UEs using a
broadcast session. A UE can receive a broadcast communication service in
RRC_IDLE, RRC_INACTIVE and RRC_CONNECTED state.

For multicast communication service, the same service and the same
specific content data are provided simultaneously to a dedicated set of
UEs (i.e., not all UEs in the MBS service area as defined in TS 23.247
\[45\] are authorized to receive the data). A multicast communication
service is delivered to the UEs using a multicast session. A UE can
receive a multicast communication service in RRC_CONNECTED state with
mechanisms such as PTP and/or PTM delivery and/or in RRC_INACTIVE state
with PTM delivery, as defined in clause 16.10.5.4. HARQ
feedback/retransmission can be applied to both PTP and PTM transmission
in RRC_CONNECTED state.

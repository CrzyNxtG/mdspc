### 16.5.4 Fallback

RAT fallback towards E-UTRA connected to 5GC is performed when NR does
not support Emergency Services and System fallback towards E-UTRA
connected to EPS is performed when 5GC does not support Emergency
Services. Depending on factors such as CN interface availability,
network configuration and radio conditions, the fallback procedure
results in either CONNECTED state mobility (handover procedure) or IDLE
state mobility (redirection) - see TS 23.501 \[3\] and TS 38.331 \[12\].

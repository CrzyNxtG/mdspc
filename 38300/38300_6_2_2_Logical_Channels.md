### 6.2.2 Logical Channels

Different kinds of data transfer services as offered by MAC. Each
logical channel type is defined by what type of information is
transferred. Logical channels are classified into two groups: Control
Channels and Traffic Channels. Control channels are used for the
transfer of control plane information only:

\- Broadcast Control Channel (BCCH): a downlink channel for broadcasting
system control information.

\- Paging Control Channel (PCCH): a downlink channel that carries paging
messages.

\- Common Control Channel (CCCH): channel for transmitting control
information between UEs and network. This channel is used for UEs having
no RRC connection with the network.

\- Dedicated Control Channel (DCCH): a point-to-point bi-directional
channel that transmits dedicated control information between a UE and
the network. Used by UEs having an RRC connection.

Traffic channels are used for the transfer of user plane information
only:

**-** Dedicated Traffic Channel (DTCH): point-to-point channel,
dedicated to one UE, for the transfer of user information. A DTCH can
exist in both uplink and downlink.

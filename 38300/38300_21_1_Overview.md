## 21.1 Overview

The QoE Measurement Collection function enables collection of
application layer measurements from the UE. QoE measurement collection
is supported for the following service types in NR cells:

\- QoE Measurement Collection for DASH streaming services;

\- QoE Measurement Collection for MTSI services;

\- QoE Measurement Collection for VR services.

The QoE Measurement Collection function also supports collection of QoE
measurements for any of the supported service types carried by the MBS
communication service. The QoE Measurement Collection is supported for
the following two communication service types:

\- MBS broadcast;

\- MBS multicast.

For DASH streaming, MTSI and VR, QMC is supported in RRC_CONNECTED state
only, unless the application data is delivered via the MBS broadcast
communication service.

For application sessions delivered via MBS broadcast, QMC is supported
in RRC_CONNECTED, RRC_INACTIVE, and RRC_IDLE states. QMC for the
application sessions delivered via MBS multicast is supported in
RRC_CONNECTED state only. Both signalling based and management based QoE
measurement collection are supported in NR SA and NR-DC. Further details
of NR-DC operation can be found in TS 37.340 \[21\].

NOTE: The naming \"QoE Measurement\" is used in NG, Xn, and interfaces
between the OAM and the gNB. In the Uu interface, the naming
\"application layer measurement\" is used and it is equivalent to \"QoE
Measurement\".

### 7.3.3 SI Modification

Change of system information (other than for ETWS/CMAS, see clause 16.4)
only occurs at specific radio frames, i.e. the concept of a modification
period is used. System information may be transmitted a number of times
with the same content within a modification period, as defined by its
scheduling. The modification period is configured by system information.

When the network changes (some of the) system information, it first
notifies the UEs about this change, i.e. this may be done throughout a
modification period. In the next modification period, the network
transmits the updated system information. Upon receiving a change
notification, the UE acquires the new system information from the start
of the next modification period. The UE applies the previously acquired
system information until the UE acquires the new system information.

## 4.6 Radio Access Network Sharing

NG-RAN supports radio access network sharing as defined in TS 23.501
\[3\].

If NR access is shared, system information broadcast in a shared cell
indicates a TAC and a Cell Identity for each subset of PLMNs, PNI-NPNs
and SNPNs. NR access provides only one TAC and one Cell Identity per
cell per PLMN, SNPN or PNI-NPN. In this version of the specification, a
Cell Identity can only belong to one network type among PLMN, PNI-NPN or
SNPN as defined in TS 23.501 \[3\].

Each Cell Identity associated with a subset of PLMNs, SNPNs or PNI-NPNs
identifies its serving NG-RAN node.

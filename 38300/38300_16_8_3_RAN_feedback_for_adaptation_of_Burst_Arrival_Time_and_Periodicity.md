### 16.8.3 RAN feedback for adaptation of Burst Arrival Time and Periodicity

The NG-RAN may support the proactive feedback and reactive feedback
mechanisms as specified in TS 23.501 \[3\]. The NG-RAN can provide the
feedback in order to align the arrival of the traffic bursts with the
next expected transmission opportunity over the air interface in each
direction (i.e. DL or UL) for a QoS flow. The NG-RAN may receive reports
of uplink burst arrival time in UE Assistance Information.

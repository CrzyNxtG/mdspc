### 16.20.2 Principles

Support of AI/ML for NG-RAN requires inputs from neighbour NG-RAN nodes
(e.g., predicted information, feedback information, measurements) and/or
UEs (e.g., measurement results).

Signalling procedures used for the exchange of information to support
AI/ML for NG-RAN, are use case and data type agnostic, which means that
the intended usage (e.g., input, output, feedback) of the data exchanged
via these procedures is not indicated.

AI/ML algorithms and models are out of 3GPP scope. Model-specific
performance information, e.g. model performance indicators specified in
clause 6 of TS 28.105 \[64\], is not exchanged over NG-RAN interfaces in
TS 38.401 \[4\].

Support of AI/ML for NG-RAN does not apply to ng-eNB.

For the deployment of AI/ML for NG-RAN the following scenarios may be
supported:

\- AI/ML Model Training is located in the OAM and AI/ML Model Inference
is located in the NG-RAN node;

\- AI/ML Model Training and AI/ML Model Inference are both located in
the NG-RAN node.

AI/ML Model Training follows the definition of the \"ML model training\"
as specified in clause 3.1 of TS 28.105 \[64\]. An AI/ML Model needs to
be trained, validated and tested before deployment for AI/ML Model
Inference.

AI/ML Model Inference follows the definition of the \"AI/ML inference\"
as defined in clause 3.1 of TS 28.105 \[64\].

### 16.1.2 LCP Restrictions

With LCP restrictions in MAC, RRC can restrict the mapping of a logical
channel to a subset of the configured cells, numerologies, PUSCH
transmission durations, configured grant configurations and control
whether a logical channel can utilise the resources allocated by a Type
1 Configured Grant (see clause 10.3) or whether a logical channel can
utilise dynamic grants indicating a certain physical priority level.
With such restrictions, it then becomes possible to reserve, for
instance, the numerology with the largest subcarrier spacing and/or
shortest PUSCH transmission duration for URLLC services. Furthermore,
RRC can associate logical channels with different SR configurations, for
instance, to provide more frequent SR opportunities to URLLC services.

### 15.4.1 General

The aim of this function is to reduce operational expenses through
energy savings.

The function allows, for example in a deployment where capacity boosters
can be distinguished from cells providing basic coverage, to optimize
energy consumption enabling the possibility for an E-UTRA or NR cell
providing additional capacity via single or dual connectivity, to be
switched off when its capacity is no longer needed and to be
re-activated on a need basis, or to support various adaptation
techniques in time, frequency, spatial and power domains.

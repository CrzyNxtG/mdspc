### 21.2.5 Per-slice QoE Measurement

When a service is provided within a configured slice, the QoE
Measurement for this service type can also be configured together with
the corresponding slice scope, so that the user experience of this
service can also be evaluated on a per-slice basis. Multiple QoE
measurement configurations can be configured for the same service type,
and each configuration can pertain to different slices, where each QoE
measurement configuration is identified with a QoE reference.

The UE includes the network slice identifier inside the QoE measurement
report container when sending the QoE measurement reports.

## 22.2 Dynamic-grant PUSCH transmission

If *ssb-Index* is provided in *RACH-LessHO,* the UE may assume that the
DM-RS antenna port associated with the PDCCH receptions for scheduling
initial PUSCH transmission and the SS/PBCH block indicated by
*ssb-Index* are quasi co-located with respect to average gain and quasi
co-location \'typeA\' or \'typeD\' properties.

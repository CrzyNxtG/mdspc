### 16.2.2 PSCCH

A UE determines a power $P_{PSCCH}(i)$ for a PSCCH transmission on a
resource pool in PSCCH-PSSCH transmission occasion $i$ as

$P_{PSCCH}(i) = 10\log_{10}\left( \frac{M_{RB}^{PSCCH}(i)}{M_{RB}^{PSSCH}(i)} \right) + P_{PSSCH}(i)$
\[dBm\]

where

\- $P_{PSSCH}(i)$ is specified in clause 16.2.1

\- $M_{\text{RB}}^{\text{PSCCH}}(i)$ is a number of resource blocks for
the PSCCH transmission in PSCCH-PSSCH transmission occasion $i$

\- $M_{RB}^{PSSCH}(i)$ is a number of resource blocks for PSCCH-PSSCH
transmission occasion $i$

For a PSCCH transmission by a UE on a dedicated SL PRS resource pool, a
power of the PSCCH transmission in a slot is same as a power of SL PRS
transmission by the UE in the slot. The UE determines the power as
described in Clause 16.2.3A.

For sidelink co-channel coexistence between E-UTRA and NR, and for NR
PSCCH/PSSCH transmissions with SCS configuration $\mu = 1$ in slots that
overlap with an E-UTRA subframe on the sidelink, the UE transmits NR
PSCCH/PSSCH in the earlier overlapping slot with a power that is larger
than or equal to the power in the later overlapping slot.

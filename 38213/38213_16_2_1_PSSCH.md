### 16.2.1 PSSCH

A UE determines a power $P_{\text{PSSCH}}(i)$ for a PSSCH transmission
on a resource pool in symbols where a corresponding PSCCH is not
transmitted in PSCCH-PSSCH transmission occasion $i$ on active SL BWP
$b$ of carrier $f$ as:

$P_{\text{PSSCH}}(i) = \min\left( P_{\text{CMAX}},P_{\text{MAX},CBR},\min\left( P_{\text{PSSCH},D}(i),P_{\text{PSSCH},SL}(i) \right) \right)$
\[dBm\]

where

\- $P_{\text{CMAX}}$ is defined in \[8-1, TS 38.101-1\]

\- $P_{\text{MAX},CBR}$ is determined by a value of *sl-MaxTxPower*
based on a priority level of the PSSCH transmission and a CBR range that
includes a CBR measured in slot $i - N$ \[6, TS 38.214\]; if
*sl-MaxTxPower* is not provided, then
$P_{\text{MAX},CBR} = P_{\text{CMAX}}$;

\- if *dl-P0-PSSCH-PSCCH* is provided

\-
$P_{\text{PSSCH},D}(i) = P_{\text{O},D} + 10\log_{10}\left( 2^{\mu} \cdot M_{\text{RB}}^{\text{PSSCH}}(i) \right) + \alpha_{D} \cdot PL_{D}$
\[dBm\]

\- else

\-
$P_{\text{PSSCH},D}(i) = \min\left( P_{\text{CMAX}},P_{\text{MAX},CBR} \right)$
\[dBm\]

where

\- $P_{\text{O},D}$ is a value of *dl-P0-PSSCH-PSCCH-r17* if using the
parameter is supported by the UE and the parameter is provided; else
*dl-P0-PSSCH-PSCCH-r16* if provided

\- $\alpha_{D}$ is a value of *dl-Alpha-PSSCH-PSCCH*, if provided; else,
$\alpha_{D} = 1$

\- $PL_{D} = PL_{b,f,c}(q_{d})$ when the active SL BWP is on a serving
cell $c$, as described in clause 7.1.1 except that

\- the RS resource is the one the UE uses for determining a power of a
PUSCH transmission scheduled by a DCI format 0_0 in serving cell $c$
when the UE is configured to monitor PDCCH for detection of DCI format
0_0 in serving cell $c$

\- the RS resource is the one corresponding to the SS/PBCH block the UE
uses to obtain MIB when the UE is not configured to monitor PDCCH for
detection of DCI format 0_0 in serving cell $c$

\- $M_{\text{RB}}^{\text{PSSCH}}(i)$ is a number of resource blocks for
the PSSCH transmission occasion $i$ and $\mu$ is a SCS configuration

\- if *sl-P0-PSSCH-PSCCH* is provided, if a SCI format scheduling the
PSSCH transmission includes a cast type indicator field indicating
unicast or is SCI format 2-C, and if a $higher\ layer\ filtered\ RSRP$
is reported to the UE transmitting the PSSCH from the UE intended to
receive the PSCCH-PSSCH transmission

\-
$P_{\text{PSSCH},SL}(i) = P_{\text{O},SL} + 10\log_{10}\left( 2^{\mu} \cdot M_{\text{RB}}^{\text{PSSCH}}(i) \right) + \alpha_{SL} \cdot PL_{SL}$
\[dBm\]

\- else

\-
$P_{\text{PSSCH,SL}}(i) = \min\left( P_{\text{CMAX}},P_{\text{PSSCH},D}(i) \right)$
\[dBm\]

where

\- $P_{\text{O},SL}$ is a value of *sl-P0-PSSCH-PSCCH-r17*, if using the
parameter is supported by the UE and the parameter is provided; else
*sl-P0-PSSCH-PSCCH-r16* if provided

\- $\alpha_{SL}$ is a value of *sl-Alpha-PSSCH-PSCCH*, if provided;
else, $\alpha_{SL} = 1$

\- $PL_{SL} = \ referenceSignalPower\ â€“\ higher\ layer\ filtered\ RSRP$,
where

\- $referenceSignalPower$ is obtained from a PSSCH transmit power per RE
summed over the antenna ports of the UE, higher layer filtered across
PSSCH transmission occasions using a filter configuration provided by
*sl-FilterCoefficient*, and

\- $higher\ layer\ filtered\ RSRP$ is a RSRP, as defined in \[7, TS
38.215\], that is reported to the UE from a UE receiving the PSCCH-PSSCH
transmission and is obtained from a PSSCH DM-RS using a filter
configuration provided by *sl-FilterCoefficient*

\- $M_{\text{RB}}^{\text{PSSCH}}(i)$ is a number of resource blocks for
PSCCH-PSSCH transmission occasion $i$ and $\mu$ is a SCS configuration

The UE splits the power $P_{\text{PSSCH}}(i)$ equally across the antenna
ports on which the UE transmits the PSSCH with non-zero power.

A UE determines a power $P_{\text{PSSCH2}}(i)$ for a PSSCH transmission
on a resource pool in the symbols where a corresponding PSCCH is
transmitted in PSCCH-PSSCH transmission occasion $i$ on active SL BWP
$b$ of carrier $f$ as

$P_{PSSCH2}(i) = 10\log_{10}\left( \frac{M_{RB}^{PSSCH}(i) - M_{RB}^{PSCCH}(i)}{M_{RB}^{PSSCH}(i)} \right) + P_{PSSCH}(i)$
\[dBm\]

where $M_{\text{RB}}^{\text{PSCCH}}(i)$ is a number of resource blocks
for the corresponding PSCCH transmission in PSCCH-PSSCH transmission
occasion $i$.

The UE splits the power $P_{PSSCH2}(i)$ equally across the antenna ports
on which the UE transmits the PSSCH with non-zero power.

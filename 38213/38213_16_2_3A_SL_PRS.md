### 16.2.3A SL PRS

A UE determines a power $P_{SL - PRS}(i)$ for a SL PRS transmission on a
resource pool in SL PRS transmission occasion $i$ on active SL BWP $b$
of carrier $f$ as:

$$P_{SL - PRS}(i) = \min\left( P_{CMAX},P_{MAX,CBR},\min\left( P_{SL - PRS,D}(i),\ P_{SL - PRS,SL}(i) \right) \right)$$

where,

\- $P_{CMAX}$ is defined in \[8-1, TS 38.101-1\]

\- $P_{MAX,CBR}$ is determined by

\- if the resource pool is a shared SL PRS resource pool, a value of
*sl-MaxTxPower* based on a priority level and a CBR range for a CBR
measured in slot $i - N$, where $N$ is the congestion control processing
time \[6, TS 38.214\]; if *sl-MaxTxPower* is not provided,
$P_{\text{MAX},CBR} = P_{\text{CMAX}}$. The priority level is same for
PSSCH and SL PRS

\- if the resource pool is a dedicated SL PRS resource pool, a value of
*sl-PRS-MaxTx-Power* based on a priority level and a CBR range for a CBR
measured in slot $i - N$, where $N$ is the congestion control processing
time \[6, TS 38.214\]; if *sl-PRS-MaxTx-Power* is not provided,
$P_{\text{MAX,CBR}} = P_{\text{CMAX}}$. The priority level is for SL PRS

\- if a value for $P_{O,D}$ is provided

\-
$P_{SL - PRS,D}(i) = P_{O,D} + 10\log_{10}\left( 2^{\mu} \bullet M_{RB}^{SL - PRS}(i) \right) + \alpha_{D} \bullet PL_{D}$
\[dBm\]

\- else

\- $P_{SL - PRS,D}(i) = \min\left( P_{CMAX},P_{MAX,CBR} \right)$ \[dBm\]

where

\- if the resource pool is a shared SL PRS resource pool, $P_{O,D}$ is a
value of *dl-P0-PSSCH-PSCCH* or *dl-P0-PSSCH-PSCCH-r17*; else, if the
resource pool is a dedicated SL PRS resource pool, $P_{O,D}$ is a value
of *dl-P0-SL-PRS*

\- if the resource pool is a shared SL PRS resource pool, $\alpha_{D}$
is a value of *dl-Alpha-PSSCH-PSCCH*, if provided, and $\alpha_{D} = 1$
if *dl-Alpha-PSSCH-PSCCH* is not provided; else, if the resource pool is
a dedicated SL PRS resource pool, $\alpha_{D}$ is provided by
*dl-Alpha-SL-PRS*, if provided, and $\alpha_{D} = 1$ if
*dl-Alpha-SL-PRS* is not provided

\- $PL_{D} = PL_{b,f,c}(q_{d})$ when the active SL BWP is on a serving
cell $c$, as described in clause 7.1.1 except that

\- the RS resource $q_{d}$ is the one the UE uses for determining a
power of a PUSCH transmission scheduled by a DCI format 0_0 in serving
cell $c$ when the UE is configured to monitor PDCCH for detection of DCI
format 0_0 in serving cell $c$

\- the RS resource $q_{d}$ is the one corresponding to the SS/PBCH block
the UE uses to obtain MIB when the UE is not configured to monitor PDCCH
for detection of DCI format 0_0 in serving cell $c$

\- $M_{RB}^{SL - PRS}(i)$ is a number of resource blocks for the SL PRS
transmission occasion $i$ and $\mu$ is a SCS configuration for the SL
PRS transmission

\- if a value for $P_{O,SL}$ is provided, if a SCI format scheduling the
SL PRS transmission includes a cast type indicator field indicating
unicast, and if a $higher\ layer\ filtered\ RSRP$ is reported to the UE
transmitting the SL PRS from the UE intended to receive the SL PRS

\-
$P_{SL - PRS,SL}(i) = P_{O,SL} + 10\log_{10}\left( 2^{\mu} \bullet M_{RB}^{SL - PRS}(i) \right) + \alpha_{SL} \bullet PL_{SL}$
\[dBm\]

\- else

\- $P_{SL - PRS,SL}(i) = \min\left( P_{CMAX},P_{SL - PRS,D}(i) \right)$
\[dBm\]

where

\- if the resource pool is a shared SL PRS resource pool, $P_{O,SL}$ is
a value of *sl-P0-PSSCH-PSCCH* or *sl-P0-PSSCH-PSCCH-r17*; else, if the
resource pool is dedicated for SL PRS transmissions, $P_{O,SL}$ is a
value of *sl-P0-SL-PRS*

\- if the resource pool is a shared SL PRS resource pool, $\alpha_{SL}$
is a value of *sl-Alpha-PSSCH-PSCCH*, if provided and $\alpha_{SL} = 1$
if *sl-Alpha-PSSCH-PSCCH* is not provided; else, if the resource pool is
a dedicated SL PRS resource pool, $\alpha_{SL}$ is provided by
*sl-Alpha-SL-PRS* if provided, and $\alpha_{SL} = 1$ if
*sl-Alpha-SL-PRS* is not provided

*-* $PL_{SL} = referenceSignalPower\ â€“\ higher\ layer\ filtered\ RSRP$,
where

\- $referenceSignalPower$ is obtained

\- if the resource pool is a shared SL PRS resource pool, from a PSSCH
transmit power per RE summed over the antenna ports of the UE and higher
layer filtered across PSSCH transmission occasions using a filter
configuration provided by *sl-FilterCoefficient*,

\- else, if the resource pool is a dedicated SL PRS resource pool, from
a SL PRS transmit power per RE and higher layer filtered across SL PRS
transmission occasions using a filter configuration provided by
*sl-FilterCoefficient*

\- $higher\ layer\ filtered\ RSRP$ is a RSRP, as defined in \[7, TS
38.215\], that is reported to the UE from a UE receiving the SL PRS
transmission and is obtained

\- if the resource pool is a shared SL PRS resource pool, from a PSSCH
DM-RS using a filter configuration provided by *sl-FilterCoefficient*

\- else, if the resource pool is a dedicated SL PRS resource pool, from
a SL PRS using a filter configuration provided by *sl-FilterCoefficient*

\- $M_{RB}^{SL - PRS}(i)$ is a number of resource blocks for the SL PRS
transmission occasion $i$ and $\mu$ is a SCS configuration for the SL
PRS transmission

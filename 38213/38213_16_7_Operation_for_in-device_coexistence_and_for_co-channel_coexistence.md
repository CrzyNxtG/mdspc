## 16.7 Operation for in-device coexistence and for co-channel coexistence

If a UE would transmit or receive a first channel/signal using E-UTRA
radio access and a second channel/signal using NR radio access, when

\- the first channel/signal and the second channel/signal are
time-division multiplexed, and

\- the UE knows the frame indexes of the first channel/signal and the
frame indexes of the second channel/signal,

the UE transmits or receives each channel/signal so that the subframe
boundary of the second channel/signal is aligned with the subframe
boundary of the first channel/signal where the subframe boundary
alignment is achieved by UE implementation means.

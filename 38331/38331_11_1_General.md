## 11.1 General

This clause specifies RRC messages that are transferred between network
nodes. These RRC messages may be transferred to or from the UE via
another Radio Access Technology. Consequently, these messages have
similar characteristics as the RRC messages that are transferred across
the NR radio interface, i.e. the same transfer syntax and protocol
extension mechanisms apply.

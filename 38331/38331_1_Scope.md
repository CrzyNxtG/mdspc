#  1 Scope

The present document specifies the Radio Resource Control protocol for
the radio interface between UE and NG-RAN.

The scope of the present document also includes:

\- the radio related information transported in a transparent container
between source gNB and target gNB upon inter gNB handover;

\- the radio related information transported in a transparent container
between a source or target gNB and another system upon inter RAT
handover.

\- the radio related information transported in a transparent container
between a source eNB and target gNB during E-UTRA-NR Dual Connectivity.

The RRC protocol is also used to configure the radio interface between
an IAB-node and its parent node \[2\], and the radio interface between
an NCR-node and gNB \[2\].

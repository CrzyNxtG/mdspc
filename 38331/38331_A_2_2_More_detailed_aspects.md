## A.2.2 More detailed aspects

The following more detailed conventions should be used:

\- Bullets:

\- Capitals should be used in the same manner as in other parts of the
procedural text i.e. in most cases no capital applies since the bullets
are part of the sentence starting with \'The UE shall:\'

\- All bullets, including the last one in a clause, should end with a
semi-colon i.e. an \';.

\- Conditions:

\- Whenever multiple conditions apply, a semi-colon should be used at
the end of each conditions with the exception of the last one, i.e. as
in \'if cond1, or cond2.

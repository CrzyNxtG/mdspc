## A.2.1 General principles

The procedural specification provides an overall high level description
regarding the UE behaviour in a particular scenario.

It should be noted that most of the UE behaviour associated with the
reception of a particular field is covered by the applicable parts of
the PDU specification. The procedural specification may also include
specific details of the UE behaviour upon reception of a field, but
typically this should be done only for cases that are not easy to
capture in the PDU clause e.g. general actions, more complicated actions
depending on the value of multiple fields.

Likewise, the procedural specification need not specify the UE
requirements regarding the setting of fields within the messages that
are sent to the network i.e. this may also be covered by the PDU
specification.

# A.8 Miscellaneous

The following miscellaneous convention should be used:

\- UE capabilities: TS 38.306 \[26\] specifies that the network should
in general respect the UE\'s capabilities. Hence there is no need to
include statement clarifying that the network, when setting the value of
a certain configuration field, shall respect the related UE capabilities
unless there is a particular need e.g. particularly complicated cases.

\- UE capabilities: If a UE capability for a feature requires at least
FR1/FR2 or at least FDD/TDD differentiation, it is defined in per band
signaling (under *BandNR* in *RF-Parameters*) in the ASN.1, i.e. no new
UE capabilities is defined in the FR1/FR2 and FDD/TDD differentiation
capability signaling branches.

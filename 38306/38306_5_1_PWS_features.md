| **CMAS**                                                              |
|                                                                       |
| It is optional for UE to support CMAS reception as specified in TS    |
| 38.331 \[9\]. It is optional for a CMAS-capable UE to support         |
| Geofencing information (*warningAreaCoordinates*) as specified in TS  |

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **ETWS**                                                              |
|                                                                       |

|                                                                       |
| It is optional for UE to support Korean Public Alert System (KPAS)    |
| reception as specified in TS 38.331 \[9\]. KPAS uses the same AS      |
| mechanisms as defined for CMAS. Therefore a KPAS-capable UE shall     |
| support all behaviour that is included in TS 38.331 \[9\] and TS      |
| 38.304 \[21\] for a CMAS-capable UE.                                  |

| It is optional for UE to support EU-Alert reception as specified in   |
| TS 38.331 \[9\]. EU-Alert uses the same AS mechanisms as defined for  |
| CMAS. Therefore a EU-Alert-capable UE shall support all behaviour     |
| that is included in TS 38.331 \[9\] and TS 38.304 \[21\] for a        |
| CMAS-capable UE.                                                      |

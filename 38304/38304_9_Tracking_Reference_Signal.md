# 9 Tracking Reference Signal

The UE in RRC_IDLE and RRC_INACTIVE states may use Tracking Reference
Signal (TRS) whose configurations are provided in system information for
its paging reception to save power. In a cell in which TRS are available
for the UE in RRC_IDLE and RRC_INACTIVE states to use, the availability
of the configured TRS is informed to the UEs in RRC_IDLE and
RRC_INACTIVE states based on explicit L1 based availability indication
defined in TS 38.213 \[4\].

#  1 Scope

The present document specifies the Access Stratum (AS) part of the UE
procedures in RRC_IDLE state (also called Idle mode) and RRC_INACTIVE
state. The non-access stratum (NAS) part of Idle mode procedures and
processes is specified in TS 23.122 \[9\].

The present document specifies the model for the functional division
between the NAS and AS in a UE.

The present document applies to all UEs that support at least NR Radio
Access, including multi-RAT UEs as described in 3GPP specifications, in
the following cases:

\- When the UE is camped on a NR cell;

\- When the UE is searching for a cell to camp on;

NOTE: When the UE is camped on or searching for a cell to camp on
belonging to other RATs, the UE behaviour is described in the
specifications of the other RATs.

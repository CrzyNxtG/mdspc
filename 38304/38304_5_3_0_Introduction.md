### 5.3.0 Introduction

There are two mechanisms which allow an operator to impose cell
reservations or access restrictions. The first mechanism uses indication
of cell status and special reservations for control of cell selection
and reselection procedures. The second mechanism, referred to as Unified
Access Control as specified in TS 38.331 \[3\], shall allow preventing
selected access categories or access identities from sending initial
access messages for load control reasons.

Unified Access Control does not apply to IAB-MTs and NCR-MTs.

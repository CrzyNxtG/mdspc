### 7.3.0 General

If PEI and subgrouping are configured, UEs monitoring the same PO can be
divided into one or more subgroups. With subgrouping, the UE monitors
the associated PO if the corresponding bit for subgroup the UE belongs
to is indicated as 1 by PEI corresponding to its PO, as specified in
clause 10.4a in TS 38.213 \[4\].

The following parameters are used for the determination of subgroup ID:

\- *subgroupsNumPerPO*: total number of subgroups for both CN assigned
subgrouping (if any) and UE_ID based subgrouping (if any) in a PO, which
is broadcasted in system information;

\- *subgroupsNumForUEID*: number of subgroups for UE_ID based
subgrouping in a PO, which is broadcasted in system information.

UE\'s subgroup can be either assigned by CN as specified in clause 7.3.1
or formed based on UE_ID as specified in clause 7.3.2:

\- If *subgroupsNumForUEID* is absent in *subgroupConfig*, the subgroup
ID based on CN assigned subgrouping as specified in clause 7.3.1, if
available for the UE, is used in the cell.

\- If both *subgroupsNumPerPO* and *subgroupsNumForUEID* are configured,
and *subgroupsNumForUEID* has the same value as *subgroupsNumPerPO*, the
subgroup ID based on UE_ID based subgrouping as specified in clause
7.3.2 is used in the cell.

\- If both *subgroupsNumPerPO* and *subgroupsNumForUEID* are configured,
and *subgroupsNumForUEID* \< *subgroupsNumPerPO*:

\- The subgroup ID based on CN assigned subgrouping as specified in
clause 7.3.1, if available for the UE, is used in the cell;

\- Otherwise, the subgroup ID based on UE_ID based subgrouping as
specified in clause 7.3.2 is used in the cell.

If a UE has no CN assigned subgroup ID or does not support CN assigned
subgrouping, and there is no configuration for *subgroupsNumForUEID*,
the UE monitors the associated PO according to clause 7.1.

### 7.3.1 CN assigned subgrouping

Paging with CN assigned subgrouping is used in the cell which supports
CN assigned subgrouping, as described in clause 7.3.0. A UE supporting
CN assigned subgrouping in RRC_IDLE or RRC_INACTIVE state can be
assigned a subgroup ID (between 0 to 7) by AMF through NAS signalling.
The UE belonging to the assigned subgroup ID monitors its associated PEI
which indicates the paged subgroup(s) as specified in clause 7.2.

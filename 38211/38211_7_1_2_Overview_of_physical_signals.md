### 7.1.2 Overview of physical signals

A downlink physical signal corresponds to a set of resource elements
used by the physical layer but does not carry information originating
from higher layers.

The following downlink physical signals are defined:

\- Demodulation reference signals, DM-RS

\- Phase-tracking reference signals, PT-RS

\- Positioning reference signal, PRS

\- Channel-state information reference signal, CSI-RS

\- Primary synchronization signal, PSS

\- Secondary synchronization signal, SSS

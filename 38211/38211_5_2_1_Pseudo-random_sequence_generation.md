### 5.2.1 Pseudo-random sequence generation

Generic pseudo-random sequences are defined by a length-31 Gold
sequence. The output sequence ![](media/image9.wmf) of
length![](media/image61.wmf), where![](media/image62.wmf), is defined by

![](media/image63.wmf)

where $N_{\text{C}} = 1600$ and the first m-sequence
![](media/image64.wmf) shall be initialized with![](media/image65.wmf).
The initialization of the second m-sequence, ![](media/image66.wmf), is
denoted by ![](media/image67.wmf) with the value depending on the
application of the sequence.

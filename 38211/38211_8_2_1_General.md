### 8.2.1 General

In a shared SL PRS resource pool, the OFDM symbol immediately preceding
the symbols which are configured for use by PSFCH if PSFCH is configured
in this slot, and the last symbol configured for sidelink in a slot,
serve as guard symbol(s). In a dedicated SL PRS resource pool, the last
symbol configured for sidelink in a slot serves as a guard symbol.
Otherwise, the OFDM symbol immediately following the last symbol used
for PSSCH, PSFCH, or S-SSB serves as a guard symbol.

The first OFDM symbol of a PSSCH and its associated PSCCH is duplicated
as described in clauses 8.3.1.5 and 8.3.2.3. The first OFDM symbol of a
PSFCH is duplicated as described in clause 8.3.4.2.2.

The OFDM symbol immediately preceding an SL PRS resource in a dedicated
SL PRS resource pool is generated as described in clause 8.4.1.6.3.

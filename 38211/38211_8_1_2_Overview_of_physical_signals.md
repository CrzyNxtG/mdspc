### 8.1.2 Overview of physical signals

A sidelink physical signal corresponds to a set of resource elements
used by the physical layer but does not carry information originating
from higher layers.

The following sidelink physical signals are defined:

\- Demodulation reference signals, DM-RS

\- Channel-state information reference signal, CSI-RS

\- Phase-tracking reference signals, PT-RS

\- Sidelink primary synchronization signal, S-PSS

\- Sidelink secondary synchronization signal, S-SSS

\- Sidelink positioning reference signal, SL PRS

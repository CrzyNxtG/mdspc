### 4.4.6 Common MBS frequency resource

A common MBS frequency resource is a contiguous set of common resource
blocks. The starting position $N_{\text{MBS},i}^{\text{start,}\mu}$ of
the common MBS frequency resource $i$ is defined relative to point A and
the size of the common MBS frequency resource is given by
$N_{\text{MBS},i}^{\text{size,}\mu}$. Resource blocks in a common MBS
frequency resource are numbered in the same way as resource blocks in
clause 4.4.4.4 with $N_{\text{BWP},i}^{\text{start,μ}}$ and
$N_{\text{BWP},i}^{\text{size,μ}}$ replaced by
$N_{\text{MBS},i}^{\text{start,}\mu}$ and
$N_{\text{MBS},i}^{\text{size,}\mu}$, respectively.

> A UE is not expected to receive PDSCH or PDCCH associated with MBS
> transmissions scheduled with G-RNTI, G-CS-RNTI, MCCH-RNTI, or
> Multicast-MCCH-RNTI outside the common MBS frequency resource.

## 8.5 Timing

Transmission of a sidelink radio frame number $i$ from the UE shall
start $(N_{TA,SL} + N_{TA,offset}) \bullet T_{c}$ seconds before the
start of the corresponding timing reference frame at the UE. The UE is
not required to receive sidelink or downlink transmissions earlier than
the value of $N_{TA,offset}$, which is given in \[12, TS 38.133\], after
the end of a sidelink transmission.

For sidelink transmissions:

If the UE has a serving cell fulfilling the S criterion according to
clause 8.2 of \[13, TS 38.304\]

\- The timing of reference radio frame $i$ equals that of downlink radio
frame $i$ in the cell with the same uplink carrier frequency as the
sidelink and

\- $N_{TA,offset}$ is given by clause 4.3.1 of \[TS 38.211\],

Otherwise

\- The timing of reference radio frame *i* and $N_{TA,offset}$ value are
given by clause 12.2.2, 12.2.3, 12.2.4 or 12.2.5 of \[12, TS 38.133\].

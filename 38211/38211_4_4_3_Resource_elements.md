### 4.4.3 Resource elements

Each element in the resource grid for antenna port $p$ and subcarrier
spacing configuration $\mu$ is called a resource element and is uniquely
identified by ${(k,l)}_{p,\mu}$ where ![](media/image44.wmf) is the
index in the frequency domain and ![](media/image45.wmf) refers to the
symbol position in the time domain relative to some reference point.
Resource element ${(k,l)}_{p,\mu}$ corresponds to a physical resource
and the complex value $a_{k,l}^{(p,\mu)}$. When there is no risk for
confusion, or no particular antenna port or subcarrier spacing is
specified, the indices $p$ and $\mu$ may be dropped, resulting in
$a_{k,l}^{(p)}$ or $a_{k,l}$.

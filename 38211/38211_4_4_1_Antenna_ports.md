### 4.4.1 Antenna ports

An antenna port is defined such that the channel over which a symbol on
the antenna port is conveyed can be inferred from the channel over which
another symbol on the same antenna port is conveyed.

Two antenna ports are said to be quasi co-located if the large-scale
properties of the channel over which a symbol on one antenna port is
conveyed can be inferred from the channel over which a symbol on the
other antenna port is conveyed. The large-scale properties include one
or more of delay spread, Doppler spread, Doppler shift, average gain,
average delay, and spatial Rx parameters.

# 4 General

## 4.1 Introduction

The objective is to describe the RLC architecture and the RLC entities
from a functional point of view.

## 4.2 RLC architecture

### 4.2.1 RLC entities

The description in this clause is a model and does not specify or
restrict implementations.

RRC is generally in control of the RLC configuration.

Functions of the RLC sub layer are performed by RLC entities. For an RLC
entity configured at the gNB, there is a peer RLC entity configured at
the UE and vice versa. In NR sidelink communication, in NR sidelink
discovery, for an RLC entity configured at the transmitting UE, there is
a peer RLC entity configured at each receiving UE.

An RLC entity receives/delivers RLC SDUs from/to upper layer or N3C and
sends/receives RLC PDUs to/from its peer RLC entity via lower layers.

An RLC PDU can either be an RLC data PDU or an RLC control PDU. If an
RLC entity receives RLC SDUs from upper layer, it receives them through
a single RLC channel between RLC and upper layer, and after forming RLC
data PDUs from the received RLC SDUs, the RLC entity submits the RLC
data PDUs to lower layer through a single logical channel. If an RLC
entity receives RLC data PDUs from lower layer, it receives them through
a single logical channel, and after forming RLC SDUs from the received
RLC data PDUs, the RLC entity delivers the RLC SDUs to upper layer
through a single RLC channel between RLC and upper layer. If an RLC
entity submits/receives RLC control PDUs to/from lower layer, it
submits/receives them through the same logical channel it
submits/receives the RLC data PDUs through.

NOTE 1: In case the upper layer is BAP as defined in TS 38.340 \[7\], an
RLC channel refers to a Backhaul RLC channel.

NOTE 2: In case the upper layer is SRAP as defined in TS 38.351 \[9\],
an RLC channel refers to either a PC5 Relay RLC channel or a Uu Relay
RLC channel.

An RLC entity can be configured to perform data transfer in one of the
following three modes: Transparent Mode (TM), Unacknowledged Mode (UM)
or Acknowledged Mode (AM). Consequently, an RLC entity is categorized as
a TM RLC entity, an UM RLC entity or an AM RLC entity depending on the
mode of data transfer that the RLC entity is configured to provide.

A TM RLC entity is configured either as a transmitting TM RLC entity or
a receiving TM RLC entity. The transmitting TM RLC entity receives RLC
SDUs from upper layer and sends RLC PDUs to its peer receiving TM RLC
entity via lower layers. The receiving TM RLC entity delivers RLC SDUs
to upper layer and receives RLC PDUs from its peer transmitting TM RLC
entity via lower layers.

An UM RLC entity is configured either as a transmitting UM RLC entity or
a receiving UM RLC entity. The transmitting UM RLC entity receives RLC
SDUs from upper layer and sends RLC PDUs to its peer receiving UM RLC
entity via lower layers. The receiving UM RLC entity delivers RLC SDUs
to upper layer and receives RLC PDUs from its peer transmitting UM RLC
entity via lower layers.

An AM RLC entity consists of a transmitting side and a receiving side.
The transmitting side of an AM RLC entity receives RLC SDUs from upper
layer and sends RLC PDUs to its peer AM RLC entity via lower layers. The
receiving side of an AM RLC entity delivers RLC SDUs to upper layer and
receives RLC PDUs from its peer AM RLC entity via lower layers.

Figure 4.2.1-1 illustrates the overview model of the RLC sub layer.

![](media/image3.emf)

Figure 4.2.1-1: Overview model of the RLC sub layer

RLC SDUs of variable sizes which are byte aligned (i.e. multiple of 8
bits) are supported for all RLC entity types (i.e. TM, UM and AM RLC
entity).

Each RLC SDU is used to construct an RLC PDU without waiting for
notification from the lower layer (i.e., by MAC) of a transmission
opportunity. In the case of UM and AM RLC entities, an RLC SDU may be
segmented and transported using two or more RLC PDUs based on the
notification(s) from the lower layer.

RLC PDUs are submitted to lower layer only when a transmission
opportunity has been notified by lower layer (i.e. by MAC).

NOTE 3: The UE should aim to prevent excessive non-consecutive RLC PDUs
in a MAC PDU when the UE is requested to generate more than one MAC PDU.

Description of different RLC entity types are provided below.

#### 4.2.1.1 TM RLC entity

##### 4.2.1.1.1 General

A TM RLC entity can be configured to submit/receive RLC PDUs through the
following logical channels:

\- BCCH, DL/UL CCCH, PCCH, and SBCCH.

![](media/image4.emf)

Figure 4.2.1.1.1-1: Model of two transparent mode peer entities

A TM RLC entity submits/receives the following RLC data PDU:

\- TMD PDU.

##### 4.2.1.1.2 Transmitting TM RLC entity

When a transmitting TM RLC entity forms TMD PDUs from RLC SDUs, it
shall:

\- not segment the RLC SDUs;

\- not include any RLC headers in the TMD PDUs.

##### 4.2.1.1.3 Receiving TM RLC entity

When a receiving TM RLC entity receives TMD PDUs, it shall:

\- deliver the TMD PDUs (which are just RLC SDUs) to upper layer.

#### 4.2.1.2 UM RLC entity

##### 4.2.1.2.1 General

An UM RLC entity can be configured to submit/receive RLC PDUs through
the following logical channels:

\- DL/UL DTCH, SCCH, STCH, MCCH, and MTCH.

![](media/image5.emf)

Figure 4.2.1.2.1-1: Model of two unacknowledged mode peer entities

An UM RLC entity submits/receives the following RLC data PDU:

\- UMD PDU.

An UMD PDU contains either one complete RLC SDU or one RLC SDU segment.

NOTE: For groupcast and broadcast of NR sidelink communication or for NR
sidelink discovery only uni-directional UM mode is supported.

##### 4.2.1.2.2 Transmitting UM RLC entity

The transmitting UM RLC entity generates UMD PDU(s) for each RLC SDU. It
shall include relevant RLC headers in the UMD PDU. When notified of a
transmission opportunity by the lower layer, the transmitting UM RLC
entity shall segment the RLC SDUs, if needed, so that the corresponding
UMD PDUs, with RLC headers updated as needed, fit within the total size
of RLC PDU(s) indicated by lower layer.

##### 4.2.1.2.3 Receiving UM RLC entity

When a receiving UM RLC entity receives UMD PDUs, it shall:

\- detect the loss of RLC SDU segments at lower layers;

\- reassemble RLC SDUs from the received UMD PDUs and deliver the RLC
SDUs to upper layer as soon as they are available;

\- discard received UMD PDUs that cannot be re-assembled into an RLC SDU
due to loss at lower layers of an UMD PDU which belonged to the
particular RLC SDU.

#### 4.2.1.3 AM RLC entity

##### 4.2.1.3.1 General

An AM RLC entity can be configured to submit/receive RLC PDUs through
the following logical channels:

\- DL/UL DCCH, DL/UL DTCH, SCCH, and STCH.

![](media/image6.emf)

Figure 4.2.1.3.1-1: Model of an acknowledged mode entity

An AM RLC entity delivers/receives the following RLC data PDUs:

\- AMD PDU.

An AMD PDU contains either one complete RLC SDU or one RLC SDU segment.

An AM RLC entity delivers/receives the following RLC control PDU:

\- STATUS PDU.

##### 4.2.1.3.2 Transmitting side

The transmitting side of an AM RLC entity generates AMD PDU(s) for each
RLC SDU. When notified of a transmission opportunity by the lower layer,
the transmitting AM RLC entity shall segment the RLC SDUs, if needed, so
that the corresponding AMD PDUs, with RLC headers updated as needed, fit
within the total size of RLC PDU(s) indicated by lower layer.

The transmitting side of an AM RLC entity supports retransmission of RLC
SDUs or RLC SDU segments (ARQ):

\- if the RLC SDU or RLC SDU segment to be retransmitted (including the
RLC header) does not fit within the total size of RLC PDU(s) indicated
by lower layer at the particular transmission opportunity notified by
lower layer, the AM RLC entity can segment the RLC SDU or re-segment the
RLC SDU segments into RLC SDU segments;

\- the number of re-segmentation is not limited.

When the transmitting side of an AM RLC entity forms AMD PDUs from RLC
SDUs or RLC SDU segments, it shall:

\- include relevant RLC headers in the AMD PDU.

##### 4.2.1.3.3 Receiving side

When the receiving side of an AM RLC entity receives AMD PDUs, it shall:

\- detect whether or not the AMD PDUs have been received in duplication,
and discard duplicated AMD PDUs;

\- detect the loss of AMD PDUs at lower layers and request
retransmissions to its peer AM RLC entity;

\- reassemble RLC SDUs from the received AMD PDUs and deliver the RLC
SDUs to upper layer as soon as they are available.

## 4.3 Services

### 4.3.1 Services provided to upper layers

The following services are provided by RLC to upper layer:

\- TM data transfer;

\- UM data transfer;

\- AM data transfer, including indication of successful delivery of
upper layers PDUs.

### 4.3.2 Services expected from lower layers

The following services are expected by RLC from lower layer (i.e. MAC):

\- data transfer;

\- notification of a transmission opportunity, together with the total
size of the RLC PDU(s) to be transmitted in the transmission
opportunity.

## 4.4 Functions

The following functions are supported by the RLC sub layer:

\- transfer of upper layer PDUs;

\- error correction through ARQ (only for AM data transfer);

\- segmentation and reassembly of RLC SDUs (only for UM and AM data
transfer);

# 5 Procedures

## 5.1 RLC entity handling

### 5.1.1 RLC entity establishment

When upper layers request an RLC entity establishment, the UE shall:

\- establish a RLC entity;

\- set the state variables of the RLC entity to initial values;

\- follow the procedures in clause 5.2.

For NR sidelink groupcast and broadcast or SL-SRB4, when receiving the
first UMD PDU from a Source Layer 2 ID and Destination Layer 2 ID pair
for an LCID, and there is not yet a corresponding receiving RLC entity
for a radio bearer, the UE shall:

\- establish a receiving RLC entity;

\- set the state variables of the RLC entity to initial values;

\- follow the procedures in clause 5.2.

NOTE: The receiving RLC entity of SL-SRB0 and SL-SRB1 is established
same as NR sidelink groupcast and broadcast.

### 5.1.2 RLC entity re-establishment

When upper layers request an RLC entity re-establishment, the UE shall:

\- discard all RLC SDUs, RLC SDU segments, and RLC PDUs, if any;

\- stop and reset all timers;

\- reset all state variables to their initial values.

### 5.1.3 RLC entity release

When upper layers request an RLC entity release, the UE shall:

\- discard all RLC SDUs, RLC SDU segments, and RLC PDUs, if any;

\- release the RLC entity.

NOTE: For groupcast and broadcast of NR sidelink communication or for
SL-SRB4, the receiving UM RLC entity release is up to UE implementation.

## 5.2 Data transfer procedures

### 5.2.1 TM data transfer

#### 5.2.1.1 Transmit operations

##### 5.2.1.1.1 General

When submitting a new TMD PDU to lower layer, the transmitting TM RLC
entity shall:

\- submit an RLC SDU without any modification to lower layer.

#### 5.2.1.2 Receive operations

##### 5.2.1.2.1 General

When receiving a new TMD PDU from lower layer, the receiving TM RLC
entity shall:

\- deliver the TMD PDU without any modification to upper layer.

### 5.2.2 UM data transfer

#### 5.2.2.1 Transmit operations

##### 5.2.2.1.1 General

When submitting a UMD PDU to lower layer, the transmitting UM RLC entity
shall:

\- if the UMD PDU contains a segment of an RLC SDU, set the SN of the
UMD PDU to TX_Next;

\- if the UMD PDU contains a segment that maps to the last byte of an
RLC SDU, then increment TX_Next by one.

#### 5.2.2.2 Receive operations

##### 5.2.2.2.1 General

The receiving UM RLC entity shall maintain a reassembly window according
to state variable RX_Next_Highest as follows:

\- a SN falls within the reassembly window if (RX_Next_Highest --
UM_Window_Size) \<= SN \<RX_Next_Highest;

\- a SN falls outside of the reassembly window otherwise.

When receiving an UMD PDU from lower layer, the receiving UM RLC entity
shall:

\- either deliver the UMD PDU to upper layer after removing the RLC
header, discard the received UMD PDU, or place it in the reception
buffer (see clause 5.2.2.2.2);

\- if the received UMD PDU was placed in the reception buffer:

\- update state variables, reassemble and deliver RLC SDUs to upper

## 5.3 ARQ procedures

### 5.3.1 General

ARQ procedures are only performed by an AM RLC entity.

### 5.3.2 Retransmission

The transmitting side of an AM RLC entity can receive a negative
acknowledgement (notification of reception failure by its peer AM RLC
entity) for an RLC SDU or an RLC SDU segment by the following:

\- STATUS PDU from its peer AM RLC entity.

When receiving a negative acknowledgement for an RLC SDU or an RLC SDU
segment by a STATUS PDU from its peer AM RLC entity, the transmitting
side of the AM RLC entity shall:

\- if the SN of the corresponding RLC SDU falls within the range
TX_Next_Ack \<= SN \< = the highest SN of the AMD PDU among the AMD PDUs
submitted to lower layer:

\- consider the RLC SDU or the RLC SDU segment for which a negative
acknowledgement was received for retransmission.

When an RLC SDU or an RLC SDU segment is considered for retransmission,
the transmitting side of the AM RLC entity shall:

\- if the RLC SDU or RLC SDU segment is considered for retransmission
for the first time:

\- set the RETX_COUNT associated with the RLC SDU to zero.

\- else, if it (the RLC SDU or the RLC SDU segment that is considered
for retransmission) is not pending for retransmission already and the
RETX_COUNT associated with the RLC SDU has not been incremented due to
another negative acknowledgment in the same STATUS PDU:

\- increment the RETX_COUNT.

\- if RETX_COUNT = *maxRetxThreshold*:

\- indicate to upper layers that max retransmission has been reached.

When retransmitting an RLC SDU or an RLC SDU segment, the transmitting
side of an AM RLC entity shall:

\- if needed, segment the RLC SDU or the RLC SDU segment;

\- form a new AMD PDU which will fit within the total size of AMD PDU(s)
indicated by lower layer at the particular transmission opportunity;

\- submit the new AMD PDU to lower layer.

When forming a new AMD PDU, the transmitting side of an AM RLC entity
shall:

\- only map the original RLC SDU or RLC SDU segment to the Data field of
the new AMD PDU;

\- modify the header of the new AMD PDU in accordance with the
description in clause 6.2.2.4;

\- set the P field according to clause 5.3.3.

### 5.3.3 Polling

#### 5.3.3.1 General

An AM RLC entity can poll its peer AM RLC entity in order to trigger
STATUS reporting at the peer AM RLC entity.

#### 5.3.3.2 Transmission of a AMD PDU

Upon notification of a transmission opportunity by lower layer, for each
AMD PDU submitted for transmission such that the AMD PDU contains either
a not previously transmitted RLC SDU or an RLC SDU segment containing
not previously transmitted byte segment, the transmitting side of an AM
RLC entity shall:

\- increment PDU_WITHOUT_POLL by one;

\- increment BYTE_WITHOUT_POLL by every new byte of Data field element
that it maps to the Data field of the AMD PDU;

\- if PDU_WITHOUT_POLL \>= pollPDU; or

\- if BYTE_WITHOUT_POLL \>= pollByte:

\- include a poll in the AMD PDU as described below.

Upon notification of a transmission opportunity by lower layer, for each
AMD PDU submitted for transmission, the transmitting side of an AM RLC
entity shall:

\- if both the transmission buffer and the retransmission buffer becomes
empty (excluding transmitted RLC SDUs or RLC SDU segments awaiting
acknowledgements) after the transmission of the AMD PDU; or

\- if no new RLC SDU can be transmitted after the transmission of the
AMD PDU (e.g. due to window stalling);

\- include a poll in the AMD PDU as described below.

NOTE: Empty RLC buffer (excluding transmitted RLC SDUs or RLC SDU
segments awaiting acknowledgements) should not lead to unnecessary
polling when data awaits in the upper layer. Details are left up to UE
implementation.

To include a poll in an AMD PDU, the transmitting side of an AM RLC
entity shall:

\- set the P field of the AMD PDU to \"1\";

\- set PDU_WITHOUT_POLL to 0;

\- set BYTE_WITHOUT_POLL to 0.

Upon submission of an AMD PDU including a poll to lower layer, the
transmitting side of an AM RLC entity shall:

\- set POLL_SN to the highest SN of the AMD PDU among the AMD PDUs
submitted to lower layer;

\- if *t-PollRetransmit* is not running:

\- start *t-PollRetransmit*.

\- else:

\- restart *t-PollRetransmit*.

#### 5.3.3.3 Reception of a STATUS report

Upon reception of a STATUS report from the receiving RLC AM entity the
transmitting side of an AM RLC entity shall:

\- if the STATUS report comprises a positive or negative acknowledgement
for the RLC SDU with sequence number equal to POLL_SN:

\- if *t-PollRetransmit* is running:

\- stop and reset *t-PollRetransmit*.

#### 5.3.3.4 Expiry of *t-PollRetransmit*

Upon expiry of *t-PollRetransmit*, the transmitting side of an AM RLC
entity shall:

\- if both the transmission buffer and the retransmission buffer are
empty (excluding transmitted RLC SDU or RLC SDU segment awaiting
acknowledgements); or

\- if no new RLC SDU or RLC SDU segment can be transmitted (e.g. due to
window stalling):

\- consider the RLC SDU with the highest SN among the RLC SDUs submitted
to lower layer for retransmission; or

\- consider any RLC SDU which has not been positively acknowledged for
retransmission.

\- include a poll in an AMD PDU as described in clause 5.3.3.2.

### 5.3.4 Status reporting

An AM RLC entity sends STATUS PDUs to its peer AM RLC entity in order to
provide positive and/or negative acknowledgements of RLC SDUs (or
portions of them).

Triggers to initiate STATUS reporting include:

\- Polling from its peer AM RLC entity:

\- When an AMD PDU with SN = x and the P field set to \"1\" is received
from lower layer, the receiving side of an AM RLC entity shall:

\- if the AMD PDU is to be discarded as specified in clause 5.2.3.2.2;
or

\- if x \< RX_Highest_Status or x \>= RX_Next + AM_Window_Size:

\- trigger a STATUS report.

\- else:

\- delay triggering the STATUS report until x \< RX_Highest_Status or x
\>= RX_Next + AM_Window_Size.

NOTE 1: This ensures that the RLC Status report is transmitted after
HARQ reordering.

\- Detection of reception failure of an AMD PDU

\- The receiving side of an AM RLC entity shall trigger a STATUS report
when *t-Reassembly* expires.

NOTE 2: The expiry of *t-Reassembly* triggers both RX_Highest_Status to
be updated and a STATUS report to be triggered, but the STATUS report
shall be triggered after RX_Highest_Status is updated.

When STATUS reporting has been triggered, the receiving side of an AM
RLC entity shall:

\- if *t-StatusProhibit* is not running:

\- at the first transmission opportunity indicated by lower layer,
construct a STATUS PDU and submit it to lower layer.

\- else:

\- at the first transmission opportunity indicated by lower layer after
*t-StatusProhibit* expires, construct a single STATUS PDU even if status
reporting was triggered several times while *t-StatusProhibit* was
running and submit it to lower layer.

When a STATUS PDU has been submitted to lower layer, the receiving side
of an AM RLC entity shall:

\- start *t-StatusProhibit*.

When constructing a STATUS PDU, the AM RLC entity shall:

\- for the RLC SDUs with SN such that RX_Next \<= SN \<
RX_Highest_Status that has not been completely received yet, in
increasing SN order of RLC SDUs and increasing byte segment order within
RLC SDUs, starting with SN = RX_Next up to the point where the resulting
STATUS PDU still fits to the total size of RLC PDU(s) indicated by lower
layer:

\- for an RLC SDU for which no byte segments have been received yet:

\- include in the STATUS PDU a NACK_SN which is set to the SN of the RLC
SDU.

\- for a continuous sequence of byte segments of a partly received RLC
SDU that have not been received yet:

\- include in the STATUS PDU a set of NACK_SN, SOstart and SOend.

\- for a continuous sequence of RLC SDUs that have not been received
yet:

\- include in the STATUS PDU a set of NACK_SN and NACK range;

\- include in the STATUS PDU, if required, a pair of SOstart and SOend.

\- set the ACK_SN to the SN of the next not received RLC SDU which is
not indicated as missing in the resulting STATUS PDU.

## 5.4 SDU discard procedures

When indicated from upper layer (e.g. PDCP) to discard a particular RLC
SDU, the transmitting side of an AM RLC entity or the transmitting UM
RLC entity shall discard the indicated RLC SDU, if neither the RLC SDU
nor a segment thereof has been submitted to the lower layers. The
transmitting side of an AM RLC entity shall not introduce an RLC SN gap
when discarding an RLC SDU.

## 5.5 Data volume calculation

For the purpose of MAC buffer status reporting, the UE shall consider
the following as RLC data volume:

\- RLC SDUs and RLC SDU segments that have not yet been included in an
RLC data PDU;

\- RLC data PDUs that are pending for initial transmission;

\- RLC data PDUs that are pending for retransmission (RLC AM).

For the purpose of MAC delay status reporting, the UE shall consider the
following as delay-critical RLC data volume:

\- delay-critical RLC SDUs and delay-critical RLC SDU segments that have
not yet been included in an RLC data PDU;

\- RLC data PDUs pending for initial transmission, and containing a
delay-critical RLC SDU or a delay-critical RLC SDU segment;

\- RLC data PDUs that are pending for retransmission (RLC AM).

In addition, if a STATUS PDU has been triggered and *t-StatusProhibit*
is not running or has expired, the UE shall estimate the size of the
STATUS PDU that will be transmitted in the next transmission
opportunity, and consider this as part of RLC data volume for MAC buffer
status reporting and as part of delay-critical RLC data volume for MAC
delay status reporting.

## 5.6 Handling of unknown, unforeseen and erroneous protocol data

### 5.6.1 Reception of PDU with reserved or invalid values

When an RLC entity receives an RLC PDU that contains reserved or invalid
values, the RLC entity shall:

\- discard the received RLC PDU.

# 6 Protocol data units, formats and parameters

## 6.1 Protocol data units

### 6.1.1 General

RLC PDUs can be categorized into RLC data PDUs and RLC control PDUs. RLC
data PDUs in clause 6.1.2 are used by TM, UM and AM RLC entities to
transfer upper layer PDUs (i.e. RLC SDUs). RLC control PDUs in clause
6.1.3 are used by AM RLC entity to perform ARQ procedures.

### 6.1.2 RLC data PDU

a\) TMD PDU

TMD PDU is used to transfer upper layer PDUs by a TM RLC entity.

b\) UMD PDU

UMD PDU is used to transfer upper layer PDUs by an UM RLC entity.

c\) AMD PDU

AMD PDU is used to transfer upper layer PDUs by an AM RLC entity.

### 6.1.3 RLC control PDU

a\) STATUS PDU

STATUS PDU is used by the receiving side of an AM RLC entity to inform
the peer AM RLC entity about RLC data PDUs that are received
successfully, and RLC data PDUs that are detected to be lost by the
receiving side of an AM RLC entity.

## 6.2 Formats and parameters

### 6.2.1 General

The formats of RLC PDUs are described in clause 6.2.2 and their
parameters are described in clause 6.2.3.

### 6.2.2 Formats

#### 6.2.2.1 General

RLC PDU is a bit string. In the figures in clause 6.2.2.2 to 6.2.2.5,
bit strings are represented by tables in which the first and most
significant bit is the left most bit of the first line of the table, the
last and least significant bit is the rightmost bit of the last line of
the table, and more generally the bit string is to be read from left to
right and then in the reading order of the lines.

RLC SDUs are bit strings that are byte aligned (i.e. multiple of 8 bits)
in length. An RLC SDU is included into an RLC PDU from first bit onward.

#### 6.2.2.2 TMD PDU

TMD PDU consists only of a Data field and does not consist of any RLC
headers.

![](media/image7.emf)

Figure 6.2.2.2-1: TMD PDU

#### 6.2.2.3 UMD PDU

UMD PDU consists of a Data field and an UMD PDU header. The UMD PDU
header is byte aligned.

When an UMD PDU contains a complete RLC SDU, the UMD PDU header only
contains the SI and R fields.

An UM RLC entity is configured by RRC to use either a 6 bit SN or a 12
bit SN. For groupcast and broadcast of NR sidelink communication or for
SL-SRB4, only 6 bit SN length is configured. An UMD PDU header contains
the SN field only when the corresponding RLC SDU is segmented. An UMD
PDU carrying the first segment of an RLC SDU does not carry the SO field
in its header. The length of the SO field is 16 bits.

#### 6.2.2.4 AMD PDU

AMD PDU consists of a Data field and an AMD PDU header. The AMD PDU
header is byte aligned.

An AM RLC entity is configured by RRC to use either a 12 bit SN or a 18
bit SN. The length of the AMD PDU header is two and three bytes
respectively.

An AMD PDU header contains a D/C, a P, a SI, and a SN. An AMD PDU header
contains the SO field only when the Data field consists of an RLC SDU
segment which is not the first segment, in which case a 16 bit SO is
present.

#### 6.2.2.5 STATUS PDU

STATUS PDU consists of a STATUS PDU payload and an RLC control PDU
header.

RLC control PDU header consists of a D/C and a CPT field.

The STATUS PDU payload starts from the first bit following the RLC
control PDU header, and it consists of one ACK_SN and one E1, zero or
more sets of a NACK_SN, an E1, an E2 and an E3, and possibly a pair of a
SOstart and a SOend or a NACK range field for each NACK_SN.

### 6.2.3 Parameters

#### 6.2.3.1 General

In the definition of each field in clauses 6.2.3.2 to 6.2.3.5, the bits
in the parameters are represented in which the first and most
significant bit is the left most bit and the last and least significant
bit is the rightmost bit. Unless mentioned otherwise, integers are
encoded in standard binary encoding for unsigned integers.

#### 6.2.3.2 Data field

arrive to the RLC entity at the transmitter.

For TMD PDU, UMD PDU and AMD PDU:

\- The granularity of the Data field size is one byte;

\- The maximum Data field size is the maximum size of a PDCP PDU.

NOTE: In case the upper layer is BAP as specified in TS 38.340 \[7\] or
SRAP as specified in TS 38.351 \[9\], the maximum Data field size can be
larger than the maximum size of a PDCP PDU.

For TMD PDU:

\- Only one RLC SDU can be mapped to the Data field of one TMD PDU.

For UMD PDU, and AMD PDU:

\- Either of the following can be mapped to the Data field of one UMD
PDU, or AMD PDU:

\- One RLC SDU;

\- One RLC SDU segment.

#### 6.2.3.3 Sequence Number (SN) field

Length: 12 bits or 18 bits (configurable) for AMD PDU. 6 bits or 12 bits
(configurable) for UMD PDU.

The SN field indicates the sequence number of the corresponding RLC SDU.
For RLC AM, the sequence number is incremented by one for every RLC SDU.
For RLC UM, the sequence number is incremented by one for every
segmented RLC SDU.

#### 6.2.3.4 Segmentation Info (SI) field

Length: 2 bits.

The SI field indicates whether an RLC PDU contains a complete RLC SDU or
the first, middle, last segment of an RLC SDU.

# 7 Variables, constants and timers

## 7.1 State variables

This clause describes the state variables used in AM and UM entities in
order to specify the RLC protocol. The state variables defined in this
clause are normative.

All state variables and all counters are non-negative integers.

All state variables related to AM data transfer can take values from 0
to 4095 for 12 bit SN or from 0 to 262143 for 18 bit SN. All arithmetic
operations contained in the present document on state variables related
to AM data transfer are affected by the AM modulus (i.e. final value =
\[value from arithmetic operation\] modulo 4096 for 12 bit SN and 262144
for 18 bit SN).

All state variables related to UM data transfer can take values from 0
to 63 for 6 bit SN or from 0 to 4095 for 12 bit SN. All arithmetic
operations contained in the present document on state variables related
to UM data transfer are affected by the UM modulus (i.e. final value =
\[value from arithmetic operation\] modulo 64 for 6 bit SN and 4096 for
12 bit SN).

When performing arithmetic comparisons of state variables or SN values,
a modulus base shall be used.

TX_Next_Ack and RX_Next shall be assumed as the modulus base at the
transmitting side and receiving side of an AM RLC entity, respectively.
This modulus base is subtracted from all the values involved, and then
an absolute comparison is performed (e.g. RX_Next \<= SN \< RX_Next +
AM_Window_Size is evaluated as \[RX_Next -- RX_Next\] modulo
2^\[*sn-FieldLength*\]^ \<= \[SN -- RX_Next\] modulo
2^\[*sn-FieldLength*\]^ \< \[RX_Next + AM_Window_Size -- RX_Next\]
modulo 2^\[*sn-FieldLength*\]^), where *sn-FieldLength* is 12 or 18 for
12 bit SN and 18 bit SN, respectively.

RX_Next_Highest-- UM_Window_Size shall be assumed as the modulus base at
the receiving UM RLC entity. This modulus base is subtracted from all
the values involved, and then an absolute comparison is performed (e.g.
(RX_Next_Highest-- UM_Window_Size) \<= SN \< RX_Next_Highest is
evaluated as \[(RX_Next_Highest-- UM_Window_Size) -- (RX_Next_Highest--
UM_Window_Size)\] modulo 2^\[*sn-FieldLength*\]^ \<= \[SN --
(RX_Next_Highest-- UM_Window_Size)\] modulo 2^\[*sn-FieldLength*\]^ \<
\[RX_Next_Highest-- (RX_Next_Highest-- UM_Window_Size)\] modulo
2^\[*sn-FieldLength*\]^), where *sn-FieldLength* is 6 or 12 for 6 bit SN
and 12 bit SN, respectively.

The transmitting side of each AM RLC entity shall maintain the following
state variables:

a\) TX_Next_Ack -- Acknowledgement state variable

This state variable holds the value of the SN of the next RLC SDU for
which a positive acknowledgment is to be received in-sequence, and it
serves as the lower edge of the transmitting window. It is initially set
to 0, and is updated whenever the AM RLC entity receives a positive
acknowledgment for an RLC SDU with SN = TX_Next_Ack.

b\) TX_Next -- Send state variable

This state variable holds the value of the SN to be assigned for the
next newly generated AMD PDU. It is initially set to 0, and is updated
whenever the AM RLC entity constructs an AMD PDU with SN = TX_Next and
contains an RLC SDU or the last segment of a RLC SDU.

c\) POLL_SN -- Poll send state variable

This state variable holds the value of the highest SN of the AMD PDU
among the AMD PDUs submitted to lower layer when POLL_SN is set
according to clause 5.3.3.2. It is initially set to 0.

The transmitting side of each AM RLC entity shall maintain the following
counters:

a\) PDU_WITHOUT_POLL -- Counter

This counter is initially set to 0. It counts the number of AMD PDUs
sent since the most recent poll bit was transmitted.

b\) BYTE_WITHOUT_POLL -- Counter

This counter is initially set to 0. It counts the number of data bytes
sent since the most recent poll bit was transmitted.

c\) RETX_COUNT -- Counter

This counter counts the number of retransmissions of an RLC SDU or RLC
SDU segment (see clause 5.3.2). There is one RETX_COUNT counter
maintained per RLC SDU. This counter is reset to zero for each RLC SDU
when indicated by upper layer.

The receiving side of each AM RLC entity shall maintain the following
state variables:

a\) RX_Next -- Receive state variable

This state variable holds the value of the SN following the last
in-sequence completely received RLC SDU, and it serves as the lower edge
of the receiving window. It is initially set to 0, and is updated
whenever the AM RLC entity receives an RLC SDU with SN = RX_Next.

b\) RX_Next_Status_Trigger -- *t-Reassembly* state variable

This state variable holds the value of the SN following the SN of the
RLC SDU which triggered *t-Reassembly*.

c\) RX_Highest_Status -- Maximum STATUS transmit state variable

This state variable holds the highest possible value of the SN which can
be indicated by \"ACK_SN\" when a STATUS PDU needs to be constructed. It
is initially set to 0.

d\) RX_Next_Highest -- Highest received state variable

This state variable holds the value of the SN following the SN of the
RLC SDU with the highest SN among received RLC SDUs. It is initially set
to 0.

Each transmitting UM RLC entity shall maintain the following state
variables:

a\) TX_Next -- UM send state variable

This state variable holds the value of the SN to be assigned for the
next newly generated UMD PDU with segment. It is initially set to 0, and
is updated after the UM RLC entity submits a UMD PDU including the last
segment of an RLC SDU to lower layers.

Each receiving UM RLC entity shall maintain the following state
variables:

a\) RX_Next_Reassembly -- UM receive state variable

This state variable holds the value of the earliest SN that is still
considered for reassembly. It is initially set to 0. For groupcast and
broadcast of NR sidelink communication or for SL-SRB4 of NR sidelink
discovery, it is initially set to the SN of the first received UMD PDU
containing an SN. For the receiving UM RLC entity configured for MCCH or
MTCH, it is up to UE implementation to set the initial value of
RX_Next_Reassembly to a value before RX_Next_Highest.

b\) RX_Timer_Trigger -- UM *t-Reassembly* state variable

This state variable holds the value of the SN following the SN which
triggered *t-Reassembly*.

c\) RX_Next_Highest-- UM receive state variable

This state variable holds the value of the SN following the SN of the
UMD PDU with the highest SN among received UMD PDUs. It serves as the
higher edge of the reassembly window. It is initially set to 0. For
groupcast and broadcast of NR sidelink communication or for SL-SRB4 of
NR sidelink discovery, it is initially set to the SN of the first
received UMD PDU containing an SN. For the receiving UM RLC entity
configured for MCCH or MTCH, it is initially set to the SN of the first
received UMD PDU containing an SN.

## 7.2 Constants

a\) AM_Window_Size

This constant is used by both the transmitting side and the receiving
side of each AM RLC entity. AM_Window_Size = 2048 when a 12 bit SN is
used, AM_Window_Size = 131072 when an 18 bit SN is used.

b\) UM_Window_Size

This constant is used by the receiving UM RLC entity to define SNs of
those UMD SDUs that can be received without causing an advancement of
the receiving window. UM_Window_Size = 32 when a 6 bit SN is configured,
UM_Window_Size = 2048 when a 12 bit SN is configured.

## 7.3 Timers

The following timers are configured by TS 38.331 \[5\]:

a\) *t-PollRetransmit*

This timer is used by the transmitting side of an AM RLC entity in order
to retransmit a poll (see clause 5.3.3).

b\) *t-Reassembly*

This timer is used by the receiving side of an AM RLC entity and
receiving UM RLC entity in order to detect loss of RLC PDUs at lower
layer (see clauses 5.2.2.2 and 5.2.3.2). If *t-Reassembly* is running,
*t-Reassembly* shall not be started additionally, i.e. only one
*t-Reassembly* per RLC entity is running at a given time.

c\) *t-StatusProhibit*

This timer is used by the receiving side of an AM RLC entity in order to
prohibit transmission of a STATUS PDU (see clause 5.3.4).

## 7.4 Configurable parameters

The following parameters are configured by TS 38.331 \[5\]:

a\) *maxRetxThreshold*

This parameter is used by the transmitting side of each AM RLC entity to
limit the number of retransmissions corresponding to an RLC SDU,
including its segments (see clause 5.3.2).

b\) *pollPDU*

This parameter is used by the transmitting side of each AM RLC entity to
trigger a poll for every *pollPDU* PDUs (see clause 5.3.3).

c\) *pollByte*

This parameter is used by the transmitting side of each AM RLC entity to
trigger a poll for every *pollByte* bytes (see clause 5.3.3).

## 7.3 Timers

The following timers are configured by TS 38.331 \[5\]:

a\) *t-PollRetransmit*

This timer is used by the transmitting side of an AM RLC entity in order
to retransmit a poll (see clause 5.3.3).

b\) *t-Reassembly*

This timer is used by the receiving side of an AM RLC entity and
receiving UM RLC entity in order to detect loss of RLC PDUs at lower
layer (see clauses 5.2.2.2 and 5.2.3.2). If *t-Reassembly* is running,
*t-Reassembly* shall not be started additionally, i.e. only one
*t-Reassembly* per RLC entity is running at a given time.

c\) *t-StatusProhibit*

This timer is used by the receiving side of an AM RLC entity in order to
prohibit transmission of a STATUS PDU (see clause 5.3.4).
